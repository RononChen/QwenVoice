    // Instruction-writing canon (Qwen3-TTS official guidance + measured adherence):
    // - Imperative verbs (Speak / Whisper / Narrate) are followed more reliably.
    // - Combine emotion + pace + pitch + timbre in concrete acoustic wording.
    // - Add negative constraints for high-arousal emotions (no laughing / shouting /
    //   gasping) to avoid literal artifacts.
    // - Keep intelligibility clauses for quiet/fragile tiers.
    // - Avoid stacked intensifiers; stay under the 500-character cap.
