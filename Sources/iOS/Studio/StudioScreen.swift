/// Phase 3a — keeps the existing per-mode views (`IOSCustomVoiceView`,
/// `IOSVoiceDesignView`, `IOSVoiceCloningView`) as the owners of the
/// generation lifecycle. They render `IOSStudioCanvas` internally with
/// the right chip configuration. Future work (Phase 3b) extracts the
/// generation state into an `@Observable StudioGenerationCoordinator`
/// so the per-mode views collapse into a single `StudioBody`.

/// The prefetch coordinator and engine signposts continue to live in
/// the existing per-mode bodies. `RootView` owns the bottom chrome,
/// including the global TabDock, engine toast, and now-playing rail.
