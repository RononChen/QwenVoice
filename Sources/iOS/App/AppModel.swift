/// Root state model for the iOS app, replacing the bag of `@State`
/// properties that lived inside `QVoiceiOSRootView`. Conformant to
/// `Observable` so views read state via `@Environment(AppModel.self)`
/// or `@Bindable` rather than the legacy `@StateObject` /
/// `@ObservableObject` / `@Published` triplet.
///
/// Per `references/state-management.md`: prefer `@Observable` over
/// `ObservableObject` on iOS 17+, and pair with `@Bindable` when a child
/// view needs to write back. Anything passed by value stays a `let`.
///
/// Migration status (all phases complete, 2026-07):
/// - Phase 2: tab, studioMode, drafts, onboarding gate, player sheet
///   item live here; screens read `@Environment(AppModel.self)`.
/// - Phase 3b: per-mode generation lifecycle state lives in the three
///   `StudioGenerationCoordinator` instances below. The engine call
///   (`ttsEngine.generate`) intentionally stays in the per-mode views —
///   see the coordinator section comment. Complete as designed.
/// - Phase 5: presentation state is centralized on this model as three
///   typed surfaces rather than one `presentedSheet` enum:
///   `playerSheetItem` (system sheet), `deleteModelSheetItem` and
///   `bottomPanelItem` (edge-to-edge overlays hosted by `RootView` at
///   fixed z-order). Every custom overlay presents/dismisses through
///   the `present…`/`dismiss…` methods below so the focus-backdrop flag
///   can never desync from the item. A single enum was rejected: the
///   payloads and hosting differ per surface, so merging them would
///   churn call sites without removing any dismiss/race path.
///   System-modal presentations (fileImporter, alerts, confirmation
///   dialogs, the save-voice sheet, recorder fullScreenCovers) stay as
///   local `@State` in their owning views — SwiftUI presents them
///   modally above the app, so they cannot race the AppModel overlays.
///   Complete as designed.
