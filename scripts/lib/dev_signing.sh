# Local dev code-signing helpers for QwenVoice / Vocello.
#
# WHY: macOS TCC keys permission grants (microphone, speech recognition,
# files-and-folders) to the app's bundle ID + code-signing identity. Ad-hoc
# signatures ("-") derive their designated requirement from the binary's
# CDHash, which changes on every rebuild — so every `build.sh` rebuild used to
# invalidate the grants and re-prompt (sometimes invisibly). Signing local
# builds with a stable "Apple Development" certificate gives a stable
# designated requirement, so grants survive rebuilds.
#
# Resolution order (no identity is ever hardcoded — maintainer-privacy rule):
#   1. $QWENVOICE_DEV_SIGNING_IDENTITY (verbatim; "-" is the ad-hoc escape hatch)
#   2. first "Apple Development: …" identity in the keychain
#   3. "-" (ad-hoc) with a warning that TCC grants will not survive rebuilds
#
# Sourced by scripts/build.sh only — release.sh has its own signing flow and
# re-signs every component from scratch, so nothing dev-signed can ship.

# shellcheck shell=bash

==> One-time TCC migration: previous ad-hoc builds left permission rows keyed
    to throwaway code identities. Reset them once so the stable-signed app
    prompts cleanly (run these yourself, or scripts/permissions_doctor.sh --reset-tcc):
        tccutil reset Microphone com.qwenvoice.app
        tccutil reset SpeechRecognition com.qwenvoice.app
    Note: the first signing with this certificate may show a keychain prompt
    ("codesign wants to sign using key…") — choose "Always Allow".
