# AGENTS.md — Vocello (QwenVoice)

> Durable onboarding for Codex. **Code wins over docs.** When scope, platform, or gate expectations are unclear, **ask before editing**.
>
> **Active progress:** [`docs/development-progress.md`](docs/development-progress.md) · **Project map:** [`docs/project-map.html`](docs/project-map.html) · **Architecture:** [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) · **Role playbooks:** [`.agents/`](.agents/)

## What this is

**Vocello** (`QwenVoice` repo): local-first TTS on Apple Silicon — **Qwen3-TTS + MLX**, Swift 6, macOS/iOS 26+. No bundled weights; models download from Hugging Face. Also ships the `vocello` CLI, `scripts/`, benchmarks, and `website/`.

macOS **2.1.0** released; iOS is on-device-capable on `main`, not publicly distributed yet.
Minimum support is Apple Silicon Mac with 8 GB or iPhone 15 Pro or newer. Canonical benchmark
evidence uses Mac mini M2 8 GB and iPhone 17 Pro; support and evidence hardware are not synonyms.

## Source of truth

`Sources/` → `project.yml` → `scripts/` → `.github/workflows/release.yml` → `AGENTS.md` → other prose.

Model/speaker schema: [`Sources/Resources/qwenvoice_contract.json`](Sources/Resources/qwenvoice_contract.json). **If code invalidates a doc, update the doc in the same change.**

## Before you edit

1. **Resume active work** — read [`docs/development-progress.md`](docs/development-progress.md) when it exists, then confirm its checkpoint against the current checkout.
2. **Pick a role** — read [`.agents/<role>.md`](.agents/) (backend, iOS, macOS, release-qa, website).
3. **Inspect capabilities** — for relevant tasks, inspect the currently callable OpenAI plugin and
   skill inventory before choosing optional tooling. Installation is user-scoped and transient;
   read every selected skill before use and never infer availability from a cache directory.
4. **Minimal diff** — no drive-by refactors; preserve module boundaries and stable `accessibilityIdentifier` values.
5. **Ask** when the target platform or test scope is ambiguous. Commit/push policy is not
   ambiguous: deterministic verification is sufficient to preserve and share development work.

### After a Codex reinstall

1. Restore a clean `main` from `origin/main`; never discard a dirty tree without reviewing it.
2. Confirm Xcode, the paired physical iPhone, signing identities, and the repository scripts before
   explicit frontend acceptance. Ordinary deterministic development does not require a phone.
3. Inspect the currently callable OpenAI plugin and skill inventory for optional build/debug
   assistance. A cached plugin is not proof that its server or skill is enabled for the task.
   Repository scripts and XCUITest remain authoritative; `~/.codex` remains user-scoped state.
4. Run the deterministic development checks below. Run XCUITest only when frontend acceptance is
   explicitly requested or when preparing the corresponding platform release.

## Hard rules

| Rule | Detail / verify |
| --- | --- |
| **iOS runtime/UI = physical device + XCUITest** | Never use Simulator. XCUITest drives the paired physical iPhone; scripts provide deterministic device/telemetry proof. The generic physical-device SDK compile needs no phone. `scripts/ios_device.sh gate` remains a physical-device runtime diagnostic, not a UI-result gate. |
| **`project.yml`, not pbxproj** | After edit: `./scripts/regenerate_project.sh` + `./scripts/check_project_inputs.sh`. iOS resources: `sources:` + `buildPhase: resources` (not `resources:`). |
| **Generated output follows one contract** | `config/build-output-policy.json` owns native repository output under `build/`. Persistent Xcode caches are `build/cache/xcode/{macos,ios-device}`; packages are shared; scratch, evidence, symbols, and distribution outputs stay in their classified trees. `website/dist` is Vite-owned website output. Run `python3 scripts/build_output_policy.py validate`; never add an ad hoc DerivedData or `.build`. |
| **Release-only config** | The project has no Debug configuration or generic `DEBUG` symbol. Runtime diagnostics use `DebugMode.isEnabled` (`QWENVOICE_DEBUG=1`); compile-time test isolation belongs in test targets or a narrowly named compilation condition, never hidden app behavior. |
| **MLX pins in lockstep** | `mlx-swift` + `mlx-swift-lm` together; no Core ML. → [`.agents/backend-mlx.md`](.agents/backend-mlx.md) |
| **Engine invariants** | Prewarm slots, event streams, cancellation, memory policy → [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| **Privacy** | No PII, device identity, usernames, absolute paths, prompts, transcripts, secrets, or private metadata in any tracked content. |
| **All app UI = XCUITest** | XCUITest is the sole autonomous app UI driver for the native macOS test host and the paired physical iPhone. No Simulator, alternate desktop-control MCP, or coordinate bridge is active. |
| **No hidden test UI** | XCUITest observes genuine visible controls. Test-only code belongs in test targets; shippable app targets must not contain preview routes, invisible state markers, seeded UI state, or onboarding bypasses. |
| **One shared XcodeBuildMCP** | When the OpenAI Apple build plugins and their server are installed and callable, Build iOS Apps owns the single shared XcodeBuildMCP route and Build macOS Apps may consume it. Call `session_show_defaults`, select `macos` or `ios-device`, and set a physical-device ID only at runtime. Never configure a second server. Repository scripts remain the final gate. |
| **Codex/ChatGPT Desktop only** | This repository has no compatibility layer for another agent IDE. Codex/ChatGPT Desktop, currently available OpenAI plugins and skills, repository guidance, and repository scripts are the supported development environment. Optional user-scoped capabilities are never repository prerequisites. |
| **Publishing is deterministic-only** | Commits, pushes, pull requests, ordinary merges, ordinary CI, and release packaging require deterministic verification only. Missing models, a physical device, or XCUITest evidence must never block preserving, sharing, signing, notarizing, or uploading work. UI lanes run only for explicit frontend QA. |
| **Benchmark history is PASS-only** | Successful memory-qualified benchmark runners publish one privacy-safe record under `benchmarks/runs/` and regenerate `benchmarks/HISTORY.md`. Raw telemetry, WAVs, screenshots, traces, and `.xcresult` bundles remain untracked. Publication never stages, commits, pushes, or turns model/device availability into a development gate. The telemetry-overhead observer-effect experiment is local-only because instrumenting its `off` lane would invalidate the comparison. |
| **Raw profile traces are ephemeral** | Exact-PID profiles hash, validate, summarize, and publish before discarding the multi-gigabyte raw trace. Use `--keep-trace` only for an explicit Instruments debugging session. `scripts/clean_build_caches.sh --routine` prunes superseded local evidence and scratch DerivedData without touching the current app, canonical caches, dSYMs, models, source, or tracked history. |
| **Memory evidence must be qualified** | New publishable generation benchmarks require telemetry schema v8 plus benchmark-evidence manifest v2: exact run-scoped sample sidecars, start/stop and lifecycle boundaries, zero capture failures, ≥95% sampler coverage, and no critical pressure, memory warning/exit, `hardTrim`, or `fullUnload`. macOS app/engine totals are uptime-aligned; never add independent process peaks. |
| **Audio QA is autonomous** | Engine/language promotion uses deterministic PCM QC, fixed-seed evidence, locale-locked ASR consensus, and the applicable prosody/delivery gates. Human listening is optional annotation only. A QC warning may be tracked as `passedWithWarnings`, but it is not promotion-quality until a deterministic rule or code fix clears it. |

Every active invariant must live here, in a role playbook, or in an authoritative reference document.

## Workflows

### Implement a change

```sh
./scripts/regenerate_project.sh      # if project.yml changed
./scripts/check_project_inputs.sh
./scripts/build.sh build             # macOS compile check
./scripts/build_foundation_targets.sh ios   # iOS-only compile safety
```

**Verify:** exit 0 (build is the typecheck; no formatter/linter).

### Development verification — macOS

```sh
scripts/macos_test.sh test            # Core + XPC transport + owned Qwen3 runtime tests
./scripts/build.sh build
```

**Verify:** deterministic commands exit 0. This is enough to commit, push, open a pull request,
and merge ordinary development work. Do not invoke XCUITest solely to publish a development
checkpoint.

### Development verification — iOS

```sh
./scripts/check_project_inputs.sh
./scripts/build_foundation_targets.sh ios   # physical-device SDK compile safety; no device/UI
```

**Verify:** deterministic commands exit 0. A paired phone, installed models, and XCUITest results
are not development-publishing prerequisites.

### Explicit frontend acceptance

Run these strict lanes only when the user explicitly requests frontend/device acceptance:

```sh
# macOS: native app UI on the current Mac.
scripts/ui_test.sh macos smoke
scripts/ui_test.sh macos benchmark
scripts/macos_test.sh gate

# iOS: paired physical iPhone only; never Simulator.
scripts/ios_device.sh preflight
scripts/ui_test.sh ios smoke
scripts/ui_test.sh ios benchmark
# Opt-in isolated background-delivery lifecycle proof; never an ordinary UI lane.
scripts/ui_test.sh ios model-download
scripts/ios_device.sh gate
```

The platform `gate` commands remain deterministic/device diagnostics. They do not consume or
validate XCUITest results.

Generation UI tests first assert the visible Settings state: Custom, Design, and Clone Speed must
show installed/ready, Generate must be enabled, and the required clone voice must be visible before
any take. `models ensure` is explicit repair/bootstrap, never a substitute for that observation.

### Language-path verification (Phases 1–3)

```sh
scripts/macos_test.sh core-test                              # Phase 1 — macOS unit tests (no models)
python3 -m unittest scripts.test_check_ios_speech_assets     # offline Speech-bootstrap evidence fixtures
python3 scripts/test_check_language_hints.py                 # offline hint-gate fixtures
python3 scripts/test_check_language_output.py                # offline output-gate fixtures
scripts/ios_device.sh speech-assets                          # explicit DE/ES/JA/ZH system-asset bootstrap
scripts/macos_test.sh lang-bench --subset quick              # Phase 2 — macOS CLI hint gate (needs models)
scripts/ios_device.sh lang-bench --subset quick --label "lang-quick"  # Phases 2–3 — on-device hint + output (needs Speed)
scripts/ios_device.sh lang-bench --subset full --label "lang-full"   # full 19-cell matrix (hint + output gates)
scripts/ios_device.sh lang-bench --diagnostic-cohort                  # fixed 15-take autonomous failure cohort; no history
```

**Verify:** core-test + offline fixtures exit 0. iOS lang-bench must print **`hint_gate=PASS`**
and **`output_gate=PASS`** (quick: 6/6 output cells; full: 18/18 — negative control is hint-only).
`check_language_hints.py` matches `notes.languageHint` to `config/language-bench-matrix.json`.
Phase 3 adds locale-locked ASR via `check_language_output.py`. **DE/ES/ZH/JA output cells**
require on-device Speech assets. `speech-assets` explicitly resolves and installs the modern
DictationTranscriber modules, then reports whether Vocello's legacy SFSpeechRecognizer gate is
ready; setup and interpretation: [`language-bench.md`](docs/reference/language-bench.md)
§ Phase 3 prerequisites.
No listening verdict is required: exact fixed-seed WAV evidence, three-pass on-device ASR consensus,
PCM QC, and the applicable prosody gates own the automated result.
Corpus v2 requires at least 15 normalized words per alphabetic script and 24 normalized characters
per CJK script. Design uses the known explicit target language; Custom uses a native-language
speaker where the Qwen contract provides one. Custom pinned/Auto pairs prove hint equivalence, and
the three ASR passes prove recognizer reproducibility; neither is statistically independent audio
evidence.

### Release QA

Release packaging is gated by deterministic build, test, identity, signing, crash, and artifact
checks. XCUITest smoke, UI benchmarks, and model-dependent engine benchmarks remain explicit quality
QA, but their absence never blocks signing, notarization, artifact upload, a macOS package, or an iOS
archive/TestFlight build.

```sh
QWENVOICE_DEBUG=1 ./build/vocello bench --modes clone --variants speed \
  --lengths short,medium,long --warm 3 --voice <voice> --label "release-QA"
```

**Verify:** packaging requires the applicable deterministic platform release check. When an engine
promotion benchmark is explicitly requested, that separate quality decision also requires clean
audio-QC, telemetry comparison, fixed-seed evidence, and the applicable automated language/prosody
gates. Listening remains optional independent annotation →
[`docs/reference/benchmarking-procedure.md`](docs/reference/benchmarking-procedure.md).

## Codex tool routing

**Scripts first** for build/test and deterministic proof. XCUITest is the sole autonomous app UI
driver on macOS and the paired physical iPhone. Before using an optional skill/plugin, read its
instructions and keep actions inside the selected role's ownership boundary. User-scoped Codex
configuration and plugin state are never repository sources of truth.

| Work | Start here / use |
| --- | --- |
| MLX / engine | `.agents/backend-mlx.md`, `docs/reference/mlx-guide.md`, shell scripts |
| iOS | `.agents/ios-engineer.md`, `docs/reference/ios-app-guide.md`, `scripts/ios_device.sh` on a physical device only |
| macOS / XPC | `.agents/macos-engineer.md`, `docs/reference/macos-app-guide.md`, macOS Codex skills where relevant |
| Scripts / CI / GitHub | `.agents/release-qa-engineer.md`, shell scripts, GitHub integration when callable, otherwise `gh` |
| Website | `.agents/website-engineer.md`, Browser for localhost verification |
| macOS frontend QA | `scripts/ui_test.sh macos smoke|benchmark`; native macOS target only |
| iOS frontend QA | `scripts/ui_test.sh ios smoke|benchmark`; paired physical iPhone only |
| External systems and current APIs | Relevant installed Codex skill/plugin or connector; use authoritative documentation |
