# Agent Handoff Log — Vocello (QwenVoice)

The shared, append-at-top communication channel between the coding agents on this
repo. Each agent logs a short entry when it finishes a session; the other reads
it when picking up. The human triggers the read on handoff.

```
OWNERSHIP
  - Claude Code owns CLAUDE.md        (do not edit it unless you are Claude Code)
  - Kimi        owns AGENTS.md        (do not edit it unless you are Kimi)
  - AGENT_HANDOFF.md is the ONLY shared mutable doc.

RULES
  - Append your new entry at the TOP (just below the "NEWEST ENTRIES" ruler).
  - Never delete or rewrite another agent's entries. Only add your own.
  - This is a narrative + decisions layer on top of git — don't duplicate
    `git log`. Capture intent, decisions, and cross-agent asks that git can't.
```

## Protocol

- **ON PICKUP** (when you're told you're taking over from the other agent):
  read this file from the top down until you reach **your own most recent
  entry**. Everything above it is new to you (your topmost entry is your read
  watermark — no external state needed). Action any `Requests for <you>` items
  before starting work.
- **ON HANDOFF** (before you end a session): prepend a new entry just below the
  ruler using the template. Reference the commit SHA(s) + branch. Commit this
  file alongside your work.
- **CROSS-OWNER REQUESTS:** never edit the other agent's owned file. If a change
  belongs in `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` and you are not its owner, put the
  requested change + the **exact snippet to paste** under `Requests for <other>`
  in your entry. The owner applies it and logs their own entry.
- **PRUNING:** keep the latest ~12 entries. Older entries may be removed
  (they're recoverable via `git log`).

## 2026-06-23 — kimi — reverted to simple download + cancel confirmation

- **Commits:** (to be filled after push) on main.
- **Touched:**
  - `Sources/iOS/IOSModelDeliveryActor.swift` — removed `pause(modelID:)`, partial-byte tracking, and pause-specific state-machine helpers; kept `.paused` as a legacy decoder value and clean up any stale paused persisted state on launch.
  - `Sources/iOS/IOSModelInstallerViewModel.swift` — removed `.paused` operation state, `pause(_:)`, `simulatorFakePause(_:)`, and paused resume logic in the fake installer.
  - `Sources/iOS/IOSSettingsViews.swift` — replaced the Pause/Cancel dialog with a single "Cancel download?" confirmation (destructive "Cancel Download" + dismiss); removed Resume UI for paused downloads.
  - `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` — this entry.
- **Summary:**
  - The user decided the pause/resume model-management flow was too broken and asked for a simple download/cancel experience.
  - Tapping Cancel while downloading now asks for confirmation and then discards partial data; there is no Pause or Resume.
  - `scripts/build.sh build` (macOS) passed.
  - `scripts/ios_device.sh ui-test VocelloiOSUITests/VocelloiOSSheetUITests` passed — **7 tests, 0 failures** (after unlocking the device).
- **Decisions:**
  - Preserve `.paused` in the `IOSModelDeliverySnapshot.Phase` enum only for decoder compatibility with old persisted state; the actor now treats a persisted paused state as stale and cleans it up.
- **Requests for other:** none.
- **Open questions / blockers:** none.

## 2026-06-23 — kimi — fixed paused download byte count

- **Commits:** 1359d81 on main.
- **Touched:**
  - `Sources/iOS/IOSModelDeliveryActor.swift` — added `currentFilePartialBytes` and `currentFileLiveBytes` to `IOSPersistedModelInstallState`; updated state-machine helpers and actor progress/pause/resume/restore paths so the paused snapshot includes bytes already downloaded for the current file.
  - `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` — this entry.
- **Summary:**
  - The user reported that pausing a download showed an incorrect downloaded amount (it dropped back to the last fully completed file).
  - Root cause: the paused snapshot used only `completedBytes`, ignoring the in-progress file's partial bytes.
  - Fix: track current-file partial bytes separately from fully completed file bytes; on pause, roll `currentFileLiveBytes` into `currentFilePartialBytes` and publish `completedBytes + currentFilePartialBytes`; on resume, progress adds the resumed portion to the preserved partial bytes so the count never jumps backward.
  - `scripts/build.sh build` (macOS) passed.
  - `scripts/ios_device.sh ui-test VocelloiOSUITests/VocelloiOSSheetUITests` passed — **7 tests, 0 failures**.
- **Decisions:**
  - Keep progress persistence in memory only (not writing state to disk on every progress callback); the partial-byte fix is accurate for pause/resume and app-relaunch-after-pause scenarios.
- **Requests for other:** none.
- **Open questions / blockers:** none.

## 2026-06-23 — kimi — fixed Cancel Download from pause/cancel prompt

- **Commits:** 98c2272 on main.
- **Touched:**
  - `Sources/iOS/IOSSettingsViews.swift` — moved the pause/cancel confirmation dialog from `IOSModelRow` (per-row `@State`) to `IOSSettingsView` (parent-level `modelPendingCancel`); the destructive **Cancel Download** action now calls `modelInstaller.cancel(model)` directly.
  - `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` — this entry.
- **Summary:**
  - The user reported that choosing **Cancel Download** from the prompt did not cancel the download.
  - Hosting the dialog in the parent view removes per-row state/closure-capture issues and wires the destructive action directly to the view model, matching the working delete-confirmation pattern.
  - `scripts/build.sh build` (macOS) passed.
  - `scripts/ios_device.sh install && scripts/ios_device.sh launch` succeeded on the real iPhone.
  - `scripts/ios_device.sh ui-test VocelloiOSUITests/VocelloiOSSheetUITests` passed — **7 tests, 0 failures**.
- **Decisions:**
  - Keep the `.downloading`/`.resuming`/`.restarting`/`.interrupted` states all routed through the same Cancel prompt; Pause on an interrupted download simply pauses the retry loop.
- **Requests for other:** none.
- **Open questions / blockers:** none.

## 2026-06-23 — kimi — added pause/resume for model downloads

- **Commits:** 6a49a8b on main.
- **Touched:**
  - `Sources/iOS/IOSModelDeliveryActor.swift` — added `.paused` phase; added `pause(modelID:)` using `cancel(byProducingResumeData:)` and persisted resume data; updated `install(model:)` to resume a paused install.
  - `Sources/iOS/IOSModelInstallerViewModel.swift` — added `.paused` operation state, `pause(_:)` method, and simulator fake-pause/resume support.
  - `Sources/iOS/IOSSettingsViews.swift` — `IOSModelRow` now shows a confirmation dialog when Cancel is tapped during an active download, offering **Pause** or **Cancel Download**; paused downloads show a **Resume** button.
  - `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` — this entry.
- **Summary:**
  - Tapping Cancel while a model is downloading now asks whether to pause or cancel. Pause keeps partial data and resumes on demand; Cancel discards partial data as before.
  - `scripts/build.sh build` (macOS) passed.
  - `scripts/ios_device.sh install && scripts/ios_device.sh launch` succeeded on the real iPhone.
  - `scripts/ios_device.sh ui-test VocelloiOSUITests/VocelloiOSSheetUITests` could not run because the iPhone locked during the test bootstrap. The app launches cleanly on device.
- **Decisions:**
  - Reused the existing resume-data path (`currentResumeDataPath`) for pause instead of adding a separate pause file.
  - Interrupted/error states keep the old direct Cancel behavior; only active `.downloading`/`.resuming`/`.restarting` show the new Pause/Cancel dialog.
- **Requests for other:** none.
- **Open questions / blockers:** none.

## 2026-06-23 — kimi — removed IOSModelInstallSheet entirely

- **Commits:** bd9ac21 on main.
- **Touched:**
  - `Sources/iOS/Sheets/IOSBottomSheets.swift` — deleted `IOSModelInstallSheet` and `IOSModelInstallSheetItem`.
  - `Sources/iOS/IOSSettingsViews.swift` — removed all install-sheet presentation plumbing from `IOSModelRow`; the Install button now calls `onInstall()` directly.
  - `Sources/iOS/Settings/SettingsScreen.swift` — updated doc comment to match the new row-based install flow.
  - `Sources/iOS/Overlays/IOSOnboardingFlow.swift` — updated onboarding doc comment.
  - `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` — this entry.
- **Summary:**
  - Removed the redundant model-install bottom sheet. The Settings model row already exposes size, status, progress, and Install/Cancel/Retry/Delete controls, so a separate confirmation panel was unnecessary.
  - `scripts/build.sh build` (macOS) passed.
  - `scripts/ios_device.sh install && scripts/ios_device.sh launch` succeeded on the real iPhone; the app installed and launched cleanly.
  - `scripts/ios_device.sh ui-test VocelloiOSUITests/VocelloiOSSheetUITests` initially failed because the device UI-testing auth handshake failed while the phone was locked (`com.apple.sharing.authentication error 12 / 31`; `SFAuthenticationErrorCodeApproveFailedToPost`). After the user unlocked the device, the same test command passed: **7 tests, 0 failures**.
- **Decisions:**
  - Keep `presentFocusBackdrop()` / `clearFocusBackdrop()` because the delete confirmation flow still uses them.
- **Requests for other:** none.
- **Open questions / blockers:** none.

- **Commits:** bc80c26 on main.
- **Touched:**
  - `Sources/iOS/IOSSettingsViews.swift` — `IOSModelRow.presentInstallPanel()` now dismisses the bottom panel when the user taps Install; `.onChange(of: operationState)` no longer re-presents the sheet for active download states.
  - `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` — this entry.
- **Summary:**
  - The Settings row already shows download progress/cancel state, so the install confirmation sheet closes immediately after the user commits to install.
  - Verified with `scripts/ios_device.sh ui-test VocelloiOSUITests/VocelloiOSSheetUITests` — 7 tests, 0 failures.
- **Decisions:**
  - Keep terminal-state dismissal (installed/idle/failed/unavailable) as a safety net.
- **Requests for other:** none.
- **Open questions / blockers:** none.

## 2026-06-23 — kimi — removed dynamic Custom tone hints and fixed UI test

- **Commits:** 9b6c506 on main.
- **Touched:**
  - `Sources/iOS/Sheets/IOSBottomSheets.swift` — replaced dynamic guidance with a single static line, removed empty-state nudge.
  - `Sources/iOS/IOSDeliveryInstructionGuidance.swift` — deleted; no longer referenced.
  - `QwenVoice.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` — regenerated after file deletion.
  - `Tests/VocelloiOSUITests/VocelloiOSSheetUITests.swift` — renamed `testCustomToneTextInputAndGuidance` to `testCustomToneTextInputAndCounter` and removed the guidance assertion.
  - `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` — this entry.
- **Summary:**
  - Dropped all dynamic/conditional hints from the Custom tone sheet to keep the UI simple.
  - Updated the on-device UI test to match the simplified UI; the old guidance identifier no longer exists.
  - Verified with `scripts/ios_device.sh ui-test VocelloiOSUITests/VocelloiOSSheetUITests` — 7 tests, 0 failures.
- **Decisions:**
  - Static guidance only; no weak-word detection or live suggestions in the Custom tone panel.
  - On-device verification is required before commit/push for UI changes.
- **Requests for other:** none.
- **Open questions / blockers:** none.

## 2026-06-23 — kimi — tightened Custom tone sheet guidance text

- **Commits:** 40bd967 on main.
- **Touched:**
  - `Sources/iOS/Sheets/IOSBottomSheets.swift` — shortened main guidance to "Be specific: combine emotion, pace, pitch, and timbre."
  - `Sources/iOS/IOSDeliveryInstructionGuidance.swift` — no short-instruction nudge when the text field is empty, so the lightbulb hint doesn't appear on first open.
  - `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` — this entry.
- **Summary:**
  - User felt the Custom tone guidance was too wordy.
  - Trimmed the static guidance line and suppressed the empty-state nudge.
  - Ran `scripts/ios_device.sh build`, `install`, and `ui-test` on the real device.
  - 9 of 10 tests passed; the only failure is the unrelated cold-generation test (missing active model).
- **Decisions:**
  - Keep the dynamic weak-word / imitation-warning hints; they still appear once the user types.
- **Requests for claude-code:** none.
- **Open questions:** none.

## 2026-06-23 — kimi — added missing Surprised description in delivery picker

- **Commits:** da64da3 on main.
- **Touched:**
  - `Sources/iOS/Sheets/IOSBottomSheets.swift` — added `case "surprised"` to `description(for:)`.
  - `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` — this entry.
- **Summary:**
  - The `Surprised` preset cell was missing its secondary description; added "Animated, pitch jumps".
  - Verified all other presets have descriptions.
  - Ran `scripts/ios_device.sh build`, `install`, and `ui-test` on the real device.
  - 9 of 10 tests passed; the single failure is `VocelloiOSColdGenerationUITests.testColdGenerationCompletes` (missing active model), unrelated to this UI change.
- **Decisions:**
  - No further preset description changes.
- **Requests for claude-code:** none.
- **Open questions:** none.

## 2026-06-23 — kimi — made on-device iOS verification mandatory in AGENTS.md

- **Commits:** bd4c8ae on main.
- **Touched:**
  - `AGENTS.md` — added a firm rule that on-device verification is mandatory after any iOS UI change; compile-only builds are not enough.
  - `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` — this entry.
- **Summary:**
  - Human clarified that on-device testing after changes is mandatory.
  - Encoded the requirement in `AGENTS.md` under the iOS testing section, requiring `scripts/ios_device.sh ui-test` (or manual exercise + screenshot) before commit/push.
- **Decisions:**
  - The rule is explicitly stated so future agent sessions cannot treat `ios_device.sh build` as sufficient for UI work.
- **Requests for claude-code:** none.
- **Open questions:** none.

## 2026-06-23 — kimi — on-device verification of delivery picker revert

- **Commits:** b83cde2 on main.
- **Touched:**
  - `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` — this entry.
- **Summary:**
  - Ran the full iOS on-device UI test suite against the latest `main`.
  - Build/install succeeded; 9 of 10 tests passed.
  - All 7 `VocelloiOSSheetUITests` passed, exercising the delivery picker and custom-tone sheet.
  - Both `VocelloiOSSmokeUITests` passed.
  - The single failure was `VocelloiOSColdGenerationUITests.testColdGenerationCompletes`, which failed because the active model was not installed (`textInput_installModelButton` appeared instead of the Generate button). This is unrelated to the delivery picker revert.
- **Decisions:**
  - No code changes required; the revert is verified on device.
- **Requests for claude-code:** none.
- **Open questions:** none.

## 2026-06-22 — kimi — reverted delivery picker to emotion grid + intensity with rewritten Qwen3-TTS prompts

- **Commits:** e66f63c on main.
- **Touched:**
  - `Sources/QwenVoiceCore/EmotionPreset.swift` — restored `EmotionIntensity` and `[EmotionIntensity: String]` instructions; curated preset list to Neutral + 7 emotions + Whisper + Dramatic; rewrote all prompts.
  - `Sources/iOSSupport/Models/GenerationDrafts.swift` — restored `selectedIntensity`, `supportsIntensity`, and intensity-aware resolution/legacy mapping.
  - `Sources/iOS/Sheets/IOSBottomSheets.swift` — restored flat 2-column preset grid + intensity row; removed category tabs.
  - `Sources/iOS/IOSGenerationInputControls.swift`, `Sources/iOS/IOSGenerationModeViews.swift` — pass `intensity` binding into `IOSDeliveryPickerSheet`.
  - `Sources/Views/Components/EmotionPickerView.swift` — restored inline intensity picker.
  - `Sources/VocelloCLI/BenchCommand.swift`, `Sources/VocelloCLI/DeliveriesCommand.swift` — restored `<preset>.<intensity>` cell ids.
  - `scripts/delivery_adherence.py` — restored `.intensity` examples and defaults.
- **Summary:**
  - Reverted the delivery UI from category tabs back to the previous emotion grid with a Subtle/Normal/Strong intensity selector.
  - Dropped Documentary and Newscaster presets; kept Whisper and Dramatic.
  - Rewrote every preset prompt to use imperative verbs, concrete acoustic wording, negative constraints for high-arousal emotions, and intelligibility clauses.
  - Verified `./scripts/check_project_inputs.sh`, `./scripts/build.sh build`, `./scripts/build.sh cli`, `build/vocello deliveries`, and `./scripts/ios_device.sh build` all pass.
- **Decisions:**
  - Intensity tier copy now uses Qwen3-TTS best practices instead of the old adjective-stacking style.
  - Preset palette in `IOSEmotionPresetPalette` no longer references removed Narrator/News ids.
- **Requests for claude-code:** none.
- **Open questions:** none.

## 2026-06-22 — kimi — wired AGENTS.md to the handoff log + picked up from claude-code

- **Commits:** d1b3c7f on main.
- **Touched:**
  - `AGENTS.md` — added the `## Agent handoff protocol (with Claude Code / CLAUDE.md)` section (mirrors `CLAUDE.md`).
  - `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` — this entry.
- **Summary:**
  - Read `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` in full (no prior `kimi` entry existed).
  - Applied the ready-to-paste snippet from claude-code’s `Requests for kimi` to `AGENTS.md`.
  - Skimmed `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `CLAUDE.md`; both look consistent with `AGENTS.md` and current source.
- **Decisions:**
  - Confirmed the `kimi` author tag and the ~12-entry prune threshold are fine.
  - Will continue to leave pushes to the human unless explicitly asked.
- **Requests for claude-code:** none at this time.
- **Open questions:** none.

## 2026-06-22 — claude-code — seeded the handoff system + CLAUDE.md + docs/ARCHITECTURE.md

- **Commits:** uncommitted — working tree (files listed below).
- **Touched:**
  - `CLAUDE.md` — created (Claude-Code-tailored operating guide), then added the `## Agent handoff protocol` section.
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — created (unified, code-verified architecture map; merges the former inventory).
  - `docs/reference/technology-inventory.md` — **deleted** (absorbed into `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`; it had zero inbound references).
  - `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` — created (this file).
  - `AGENTS.md`, `README.md` — cross-reference edits only (pointed them at `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`).
- **Summary:**
  - Initialized this two-agent coordination system (shared handoff log + protocol in `CLAUDE.md`).
  - Created `CLAUDE.md` as the Claude Code operating lens; it defers to `AGENTS.md` as the canonical repo guide.
  - Created `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — modules, dependency graph, runtime (XPC vs in-process), the generation lifecycle, persistence, model management, telemetry; verified against source (`NativeMemoryPolicyResolver.swift`, `EngineServiceIPC.swift`, `GenerationMigrations.swift`, `Package.resolved`).
  - Removed the now-redundant technology inventory; fixed cross-references.
- **Decisions:**
  - `CLAUDE.md` = Claude-Code lens; `AGENTS.md` remains canonical. Source-of-truth hierarchy unchanged (`Sources/` → `project.yml` → `scripts/` → `release.yml` → `AGENTS.md` → prose).
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` is the single architecture reference (inventory merged in).
  - Going forward I will **not** edit `AGENTS.md` — any needed change routes through this file under `Requests for kimi`.
- **Requests for kimi:**
  - Review `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and the `CLAUDE.md` additions when you pick up.
  - Apply the snippet below to `AGENTS.md` (adds the mirrored handoff protocol so you read this file on pickup), then log your own entry here once done.
  - Confirm the author tag `kimi` and the ~12-entry prune threshold work for you.

  Paste this under a new heading in `AGENTS.md` (e.g. after the intro, before "Repository layout"):

  ```markdown
  ## Agent handoff protocol (with Claude Code / CLAUDE.md)

  Two coding agents work this repo. Kimi owns `AGENTS.md`; Claude Code owns
  `CLAUDE.md`. Neither edits the other's owned file. The shared coordination
  channel is `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` (repo root), an append-at-top log.

  - **On pickup** (taking over from Claude Code): read `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` from the
    top down to your most recent `kimi` entry — everything above it is new. Action
    any `Requests for kimi` items before starting.
  - **On handoff** (before ending a session): prepend a new entry (template at the
    top of `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`) — commits, files touched, summary, decisions,
    `Requests for claude-code`, open questions. Commit it with your work.
  - Never edit `CLAUDE.md` — route cross-owner changes through
    `Requests for claude-code` in `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`.
  ```

- **Open questions:** none from claude-code.
