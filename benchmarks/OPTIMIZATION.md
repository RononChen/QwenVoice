# Optimization progress

Durable record of backend/MLX + output-quality optimization work — what was investigated, decided,
shipped, and deferred. The blow-by-blow lives in git history + `HISTORY.md`; this file is the **standing
status** so a future session (or maintainer) can resume without re-deriving it. Anchored to the reference
baseline. Point-in-time as of **2026-05-31**.

## Reference baseline

[`baseline-2026-05-31-641a541.md`](baseline-2026-05-31-641a541.md) — pre-optimization reference, CLI-driven
(`vocello bench`), native floor **8 GB** tier. Headline: **RTF 0.20–0.89 (slower than realtime)**; the
**decode loop dominates wall time** and scales ~linearly with length; **clone is the heaviest** per length
and on memory (~7.4–8.7 GB physFoot in-process); `trims = 0` everywhere. Perf-over-time ledger:
[`HISTORY.md`](HISTORY.md).

## Grounding (the headline conclusion)

An external optimization report (a from-scratch iOS / iPhone-15-Pro playbook for Qwen3-TTS 1.7B) was
ground against Vocello's **shipped macOS engine**. Finding: the vendored `mlx-audio-swift` port **already
implements the large majority of its recommendations** — `small_to_mtp_projection` 2048→1024 bridge,
2048-dim speaker embedding, interleaved MRoPE `[24,20,20]`, Q/K RMSNorm, `MLXFast.scaledDotProductAttention`,
a single per-frame `eval()` (no per-step `.item()`), `asyncEval` streaming, the input-side decoder-drift fix
(`4fab110`), per-tier `GPU.cacheLimit`, fp16 KV cache, and a `compile(shapeless:)` SwiGLU. The report's two
"architecture corruption bugs" **do not exist here**. Adversarial verification dropped 7 of 12 candidate
levers as already-handled / overstated / infeasible. **The genuine remaining work is narrow**, and the
highest-value item was a quality finding, not a speed lever.

## A — Decode-loop measurement (done)

Added a per-stage **Decode breakdown** to the summarizer (`talker · sampCB0 · codePred · code2wav ·
stepEval · other`, from the `timingsMS` sub-keys already captured in the engine row).

**Key finding (changed the plan):** these are Swift-side wall-clock timers around **lazy** MLX ops, **not**
per-stage GPU compute. On custom/quality/long, `stepEval ≈ 77%` of decode is the **fused** compute of
Talker + 15× Code Predictor + sampling (the single per-frame `eval()`); `talker`/`codePred` measure graph
*build* time; `code2wav ≈ 0` because the decoder is `asyncEval`'d (Phase 2c) and overlaps the token loop —
pipelined, not free. **Consequence:** the wall-clock breakdown **cannot attribute decode *compute* per
stage**. Doing so needs an Instruments `xctrace` capture of the existing os_signpost intervals
("Talker Forward" / "Code Predictor Loop" / "Step Eval Flush" / "Audio Decoder"). This **gates D**.

## B — The ~586 ms "dropout" (done; root-caused — not an engine defect)

Effective sampling (all modes use `officialQualityDefault`): **temp 0.9, topK 50, topP 1.0 (nucleus off),
repetitionPenalty 1.05, minP 0.0**.

The baseline flagged a real ~586 ms mid-utterance silence. Investigation: it reproduced systematically on
long content (every long custom/design cell failed audioQC; clone passed), but objective analysis of fresh
takes showed **every interior silence ≥150 ms maps to a punctuation mark** — they are the model's **natural
prosodic pauses** at sentence/comma boundaries on long, slow narration, which the old fixed ≥400 ms detector
over-flagged. The one agy-confirmed genuine mid-phrase gap is positionally **adjacent to a comma pause** and
is indistinguishable from it by duration/amplitude alone (ear-only).

**Decision:** a sampling-side fix (e.g. minP floor / silence-run penalty) would suppress the model's
*natural* pauses to chase a rare, ear-only event — wrong tool, real prosody-degradation risk. Remediation
shifted to **C** (fix the tripwire); the listening pass stays the gate for the residual mid-phrase gap.

## C — Punctuation-aware audioQC recalibration (done, verified — `ac86b8a`)

`PCM16StreamLimiter` now records interior silence-run lengths; `makeAudioQCReport` counts **long pauses
(≥350 ms)** against the text's **pause budget** (interior punctuation boundaries, from `request.text`) and
flags only an **excess** beyond it (≥2 → fail, 1 → warn) or a single **egregious** ≥1200 ms gap (≥900 ms →
warn). Else `pass`. (`Sources/QwenVoiceCore/NativeStreamingSynthesisSession.swift`.)

**Verified** (re-bench custom,design × speed,quality × all lengths + deterministic replication on real WAVs
+ synthetic cases): **15/16 cells now `pass`** (every false-positive `fail`/`warn` cleared); the lone
remaining `warn` is a **real-but-natural ~1116 ms sentence-boundary pause** (correctly routed to the ear).
Sensitivity retained — synthetic 1300 ms → fail, 11 long pauses → fail. Perf unchanged (engine untouched;
see the `3da580d` `HISTORY.md` row vs the `641a541` baseline). The residual rare mid-phrase gap is ear-only;
the **mandatory listening pass remains the perceptual gate**.

## D — CodePredictor RoPE fusion (deferred; **not recommended to start**)

CP RoPE is hand-rolled (`Qwen3TTSCodePredictor.swift`); `MLXFast.RoPE` exists in MLX-Swift 0.30.6 and the CP
uses standard 2D RoPE, so it *could* swap in. Realistic ceiling **~2–3 % RTF (CP only)**. **Gate (revised by
A):** the wall-clock breakdown can't decide if CP compute is a worthwhile slice of the fused `stepEval`, so
D should only be attempted **after an Instruments os_signpost capture** of one long/quality generation shows
the "Code Predictor Loop" interval is a meaningful fraction of "Step Eval Flush" GPU time. Vendored edit →
follow [`../docs/reference/mlx-audio-swift-patching.md`](../docs/reference/mlx-audio-swift-patching.md);
must preserve exact numerics (KV precision).

## E — MLXSwift / mlx-swift-lm version pin (deferred; **stay pinned**)

Pinned `exact: 0.30.6` (mlx-swift) + `2.30.6` (mlx-swift-lm) in **both** `project.yml` and the vendored
`third_party_patches/mlx-audio-swift/Package.swift`. Latest upstream is **0.31.3** (+ `mlx-swift-lm` 2.31.x;
a separate 3.x line also exists). **Decision: keep pinned at 0.30.6 / 2.30.6.** Rationale: the backend is
vendored + hand-ported and there's no automated test suite, so the exact pin keeps the compute substrate
deterministic; 0.30.6 is the benchmarked, working version and 0.31 adds nothing Vocello needs. 0.31 is **not
a free bump** — it changes the MLX quantization API (`Quantizable.toQuantized` gains a `QuantizationMode`;
quantize moved to a top-level fn), which touches the 4-bit (Speed) / 8-bit (Quality) model-load path, and
it's a core-MLX backend bump that can shift RTF/memory (what these benchmarks track). **When upgrading**
(quarterly review, or when a fix/model requires it): branch → bump all pin sites (project.yml mlx-swift +
vendored Package.swift mlx-swift & mlx-swift-lm, in lockstep) → `regenerate_project.sh` → both
`build_foundation_targets.sh` → `vocello bench` vs `baseline-2026-05-31-641a541.md` + listening pass → keep
only if RTF/quality/QC are unchanged; otherwise document the blocker and revert. Avoid the `mlx-swift-lm` 3.x
major line unless a feature specifically requires it.

## Invariants / do-NOT (carried from the grounding)

- No hard `Memory.memoryLimit` (reverted in `b77c08e` — spurious OOM downgrades).
- No **output-side** silence gating/smoothing of dropouts (masks the root cause; risks clipping real pauses).
- Don't revert the decoder-drift fix to output-side overlap-add (`4fab110`).
- Don't pipeline the autoregressive 15-pass Code Predictor loop; don't quantize TTS KV; keep macOS
  `MLXTTSEngine.events` `.unbounded`.
- Don't "fix" the phantom 1.7B arch bugs (projection / speaker-dim / MRoPE are correct).

## iOS-deferred (real, but iPhone is compile-safe only)

Thermal-state monitoring + automatic 0.6B fallback, iPhone jetsam / `memoryLimit` tuning +
`os_proc_available_memory()` gating, on-device RTF/peak-RAM proof — all pending Apple's increased-memory
entitlement (see [`../docs/reference/ios-increased-memory-entitlement-request.md`](../docs/reference/ios-increased-memory-entitlement-request.md)).
Map to `NativeMemoryPolicyResolver` (iPhonePro case).

## Next step (if resumed)

The only open lever is **D**, and only after the Instruments os_signpost capture above justifies it. The
quality tripwire (C) is in place; everything else the report proposed is already implemented or iOS-deferred.
