# CLAUDE.md

Single source of truth for working in this repo with Claude Code. If something here disagrees with the code, the code wins — fix this file.

## What this repo is

**Vocello** (formerly QwenVoice) — a local, private text-to-speech **macOS** app running Qwen3-TTS via **MLX** on Apple Silicon. The macOS Xcode scheme is still `QwenVoice`; the shipped product is `Vocello.app` / `Vocello-macos26.dmg`. The iOS app (`VocelloiOS`) is **compile-safe only** on `main` — on-device generation and TestFlight are deferred pending Apple's increased-memory entitlement, and iPhone proof is **not** a public-release blocker. The marketing site lives in `website/` (React + Vite, deployed by Vercel from that subdir; it has its own `website/CLAUDE.md`).

Targets: macOS 26+ and iOS 26+, Apple Silicon only, Xcode 26. No Python runtime, no bundled model weights — models download from Hugging Face on first run (Settings → Model Downloads).

## Quick start

```sh
./scripts/build.sh run                       # Debug build → launch Vocello.app
./scripts/build.sh debug                      # fast incremental Debug build, no launch
./scripts/build.sh release                    # → scripts/release.sh (signed/notarized DMG)
./scripts/build.sh clean                      # rm -rf build/
./scripts/build_foundation_targets.sh macos   # clean macOS foundation build
./scripts/build_foundation_targets.sh ios     # iOS compile-safety only
./scripts/check_project_inputs.sh             # static validator — run before any build
npm --prefix website run build                # marketing site production build
```

First-time setup: `brew install xcodegen` (required), optionally `brew install xcbeautify` (prettier build output). There is no lint/format/typecheck step — **the build is the typecheck**.

## Source of truth

When facts disagree, trust in order: `Sources/` → `project.yml` → `scripts/` → `.github/workflows/release.yml` → this file → other prose. `Sources/Resources/qwenvoice_contract.json` is the canonical schema for speakers, models, variants, Hugging Face revisions, and required artifacts.

## Agent routing (Claude Code)

Before any iOS/Swift response, check whether an **Axiom skill** applies (environment/build → architecture → implementation). Use Axiom **subagents** via the `Agent` tool (`subagent_type`) for audits.

**Launch the relevant subagent before deep work, then address or explicitly defer findings:**

| Symptom / scope | `subagent_type` | Pair with skill |
|---|---|---|
| BUILD FAILED / Xcode env | `axiom:build-fixer` | `axiom:axiom-build` |
| Crash log (`.ips`, MetricKit) | `axiom:crash-analyzer` | (`xcsym` tool) |
| Engine async / actors / gates | `axiom:concurrency-auditor` | `axiom:axiom-concurrency` |
| Memory / streaming / MLX cache | `axiom:memory-auditor` (+ `axiom:swift-performance-analyzer`) | `axiom:axiom-performance` |
| GRDB / migrations | `axiom:database-schema-auditor` | `axiom:axiom-data` |
| Release / entitlements / privacy | `axiom:security-privacy-scanner` | `axiom:axiom-security` |
| SwiftUI work / perf / layout / nav | `axiom:swiftui-*-auditor` | `axiom:axiom-swiftui` |
| Full project audit | `axiom:health-check` | |

- **Backend/MLX:** `mlx-swift` (array/runtime/memory, custom ops) and `mlx-swift-lm` (generation, streaming, KV-cache, model porting, the vendored `mlx-audio-swift` stack). MLX is the only Qwen3-TTS backend — don't pivot to Core ML.
- **Apple framework / iOS 26 / post-cutoff APIs:** `axiom:axiom-apple-docs` skill + `sosumi` MCP; Xcode for-LLM guides live under `/Applications/Xcode.app/...AdditionalDocumentation/`.
- **GitHub:** `gh` CLI via Bash + `/review`. **Hugging Face:** `hf` CLI via Bash. Branch before committing if on `main`; commit/push only when asked.
- Don't auto-invoke unrelated skills (`deep-research`, `anthropic-skills:*`, `design:*`, `productivity:*`, `engineering:*`, `claude-api`). For website work use `context7` for library docs, `impeccable:impeccable` for UI/UX, `chrome-devtools` for browser verification.

## Build & project generation

The Xcode project is generated from `project.yml` via XcodeGen — edit `project.yml` (not `.xcodeproj`), then `./scripts/regenerate_project.sh`. `build.sh` skips regen / SPM resolve when their input fingerprints (under `build/<config>/.cache/`) are unchanged.

**XcodeGen iOS-resource gotcha (do not break).** The iOS app target lists `qwenvoice_contract.json`, `qwenvoice_ios_model_catalog.json`, `voice-previews`, and `Assets.xcassets` under its `sources:` block with an explicit `buildPhase: resources` override — **not** under `resources:`. XcodeGen 2.45.4 silently drops them from the `VocelloiOS` Resources phase if listed under `resources:`, so iOS builds compile but crash on first launch with missing bundled resources. (macOS uses the `resources:` directory pattern and is unaffected.) Landed in `287c969`.

**Build layout.** Only two top-level folders under `build/`: `build/Debug/` (development) and `build/Release/` (packaging) — don't add siblings. **Single-resident policy:** at most one `build/Debug/Vocello.app`, one `build/Release/Vocello.app`, and one `build/Release/Vocello-macos26.dmg` exist at a time; pruning is automatic (a running `Vocello` is quit first). Failed builds skip pruning so artifacts survive for inspection.

**Runtime data folders** (configuration-aware, never overlap):
- Debug (`#if DEBUG`): `~/Library/Application Support/QwenVoice-Debug/` — persistent across rebuilds.
- Repo-local Release (run from `build/Release/Vocello.app`): `~/Library/Application Support/QwenVoice-Release-Local/<release-data-id>/` — fresh per `scripts/release.sh` packaging.
- Installed Release (copied elsewhere): `~/Library/Application Support/QwenVoice/`.

Selection lives in `Sources/Services/AppPaths.swift` (`#if DEBUG` + the signed `QwenVoiceLocalReleaseDataID` Info.plist value + bundle path). `QWENVOICE_APP_SUPPORT_DIR` overrides the root and disables auto-migration. Don't drop `DEBUG` from the macOS target's `SWIFT_ACTIVE_COMPILATION_CONDITIONS` without moving this logic to a custom flag.

## Architecture

Two-platform Swift codebase with an out-of-process engine per platform.

- `QwenVoiceCore/` — shared engine semantics: `TTSEngine`, `MLXTTSEngine`, `TTSEngineError`, `GenerationMode`, audio prep.
- `QwenVoiceBackendCore/` — low-level MLX + audio primitives (model load, synthesis, codecs).
- `QwenVoiceEngineService/` — **macOS XPC service** (`EngineServiceHost.swift`) running generation in an isolated process.
- `QwenVoiceNative/` — macOS app-facing engine proxy/store/client (bridges XPC to UI).
- `QwenVoiceEngineSupport/` — native runtime helpers (memory policy, streaming, telemetry).
- `iOSEngineExtension/` — **iOS ExtensionKit extension** (`VocelloEngineExtension`) running heavy generation off the UI process.
- `iOS/` + `iOSSupport/` — iOS app surface (`@Observable` `AppModel`, 4-tab IA: Studio / Voices / History / Settings; design tokens are intentionally locked to the macOS values).
- Top-level macOS app: `QwenVoiceApp.swift`, `ContentView.swift`, `Views/`, `ViewModels/`, `Models/`, `Services/`.

`AppEngineSelection.current()` picks the engine per platform (macOS XPC client / iOS extension-backed). UI generation flows through three coordinators — `CustomVoiceCoordinator`, `VoiceDesignCoordinator`, `VoiceCloningCoordinator` (iOS adds `IOSBatchGenerationCoordinator`). Active Qwen3 variants: **Speed** (1.7B 4-bit) and **Quality** (1.7B 8-bit); 0.6B is verified but intentionally not listed. 8 GB Macs default to Speed, larger Macs to Quality; iPhone is Speed-only.

## Critical engine invariants (do not regress)

- **Prewarm reentrancy gate.** `NativeEngineRuntime` is an actor, but actors don't prevent reentrancy across suspension points. `ensureWarmStateIfNeeded` / `ensureDesignConditioningWarmStateIfNeeded` serialize through `acquirePrewarmSlot()` / `releasePrewarmSlot()` (`prewarmInFlight` + waiter continuations). Two prewarms racing into MLX KV-cache slice updates trips a C++ assertion and crashes the engine. **Anti-pattern:** never pair `try? await acquirePrewarmSlot()` with an unconditional `defer { releasePrewarmSlot() }` — on a throw the slot isn't held and the defer releases someone else's slot. Use `do { try await acquirePrewarmSlot() } catch { return }` then `defer`.
- **macOS `MLXTTSEngine.events` must stay `.unbounded`.** It's the streaming-preview chunk-delivery path and must not drop `.chunk` events. iOS stays bounded (`.bufferingNewest(64)`) for extension memory safety. Capping macOS (tried in `d93612c`) dropped chunks → latency/quality regressions. If backpressure ever matters, count it in `native-events.jsonl`, don't drop at the producer.
- **Generation ownership & cancellation.** `MLXTTSEngine` owns admission for all model-mutating work via a model-operation gate (one mutator at a time). Proactive warm ops defer when busy; user generation rejects cleanly when another is active. macOS/iOS stores expose `hasActiveGeneration`; XPC + extension hosts reject concurrent generation. Streaming chunks carry a UUID `generationID` (numeric `requestID` is logs-only). Vendored Qwen producers cancel their `Task` on stream termination and check cancellation in token/decode loops.
- **Per-tier memory.** `NativeMemoryPolicyResolver` picks a policy per `NativeDeviceMemoryClass` (floor8GBMac / mid16GBMac / highMemoryMac / iPhonePro): cache limits, idle-unload windows, clone-cache caps, custom-prewarm policy, and streaming tuning (`clearMLXCacheOnStreamChunkEmit` / `mlxTokenMemoryClearCadence`, pushed to the backend via `Qwen3StreamingMemoryTuning`). **No hard `Memory.memoryLimit`** on any tier — a 6 GB (floor) and 5 GB (iPhone) cap were tried and reverted in `b77c08e` (spurious OOM downgrades). floor8GBMac also: `clearCacheAfterGeneration`, adaptive idle-unload (120 s → 30 s softTrim → 10 s hardTrim), and a Quality→Speed OOM fallback in `loadModel(id:)`. `NativeMemoryPressureMonitor` maps kernel pressure → `trimMemory(level:)`.
- **Decoder drift (do not reintroduce).** Streaming and batch invoke the same `streamingStep` decoder at very different chunk sizes; `DecoderBlockUpsample.step()`'s output-side overlap-and-add once produced LSB drift at chunk boundaries. Fixed in `4fab110` (input-side `inputContext` buffer + `callAsFunction([context, x])` + discard leading samples — each sample is a slice of one conv op regardless of chunk size). Don't revert it.
- **Event forwarding.** XPC hosts drain `engine.events` on a `Task.detached(.utility)` (off MainActor) so the synchronous XPC encode can't lag the producer; only `lastPublishedEvent` hops to MainActor (via `LatestEventCoalescer`, a lock-guarded coalescing slot — no per-chunk MainActor task spawning).
- **iOS memory posture.** Admission blocking is **records-only** (`guardModelAdmission` → `model_admission_observed`) while measuring extension Jetsam without the entitlement. iOS generation is streaming-first; physical devices omit inline `previewAudio.pcm16LE` unless `QWENVOICE_STREAMING_PREVIEW_DATA=on`. `Qwen3TTSMemoryCaches.clearAll()` runs on iPhone hard-trim/unload/failure; macOS cache warmth is preserved.
- **Entitlements.** App sandbox is **disabled** (`com.apple.security.app-sandbox = false` in `Sources/QwenVoice.entitlements`) — required for MLX. Hardened runtime on with allow-unsigned-memory + disable-library-validation.

## Testing

There is **no automated UI-driving, smoke, or benchmark harness**. Behavioral validation is **manual local app acceptance**: `./scripts/build.sh run`, exercise the affected paths by hand, listen to the output. The only automated gate is build/compile-safety (`./scripts/build.sh debug`, `./scripts/build_foundation_targets.sh ios`). Don't reintroduce a test bundle, UI/bench/device harness, smoke/bench runbooks, committed timing baselines, or extra GitHub workflows without an explicit maintainer decision — `scripts/check_project_inputs.sh` guards the retired surfaces (prohibited-paths list + working-tree regex sweep).

## Release & iPhone status

macOS-first. Signoff = green build + `scripts/release.sh` package (sign/notarize/staple → `Vocello-macos26.dmg`) + manual smoke of `build/Release/Vocello.app`. CI is a single workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): `package` (macOS DMG) + `compile-ios` (iOS compile-safety only) — no tests, benches, or signed IPA.

iPhone is compile-safe only; on-device generation, memory proof, and TestFlight are deferred pending Apple's `com.apple.developer.kernel.increased-memory-limit` entitlement for `com.patricedery.vocello` + `com.patricedery.vocello.engine-extension`. The copy-ready Apple request packet is [`docs/reference/ios-increased-memory-entitlement-request.md`](docs/reference/ios-increased-memory-entitlement-request.md). (The previous on-device deploy/proof tooling was removed and would need re-establishing when iPhone work resumes.)

## SPM dependencies (pinned in `project.yml`)

- `MLXSwift` 0.30.6 (`github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift`)
- `MLXAudio` — **vendored** at `third_party_patches/mlx-audio-swift/` (Vocello-specific patches)
- `SwiftHuggingFace` 0.9.0 (model downloads)
- `GRDB` 7.10.0 (local SQLite — history, saved voices, model metadata)

## Conventions

- Vendor edits inside `third_party_patches/mlx-audio-swift/` are allowed for backend correctness/memory/streaming/perf when the fix belongs below `QwenVoiceCore`. Keep them small, preserve upstream style, and follow the validation gates in [`docs/reference/mlx-audio-swift-patching.md`](docs/reference/mlx-audio-swift-patching.md). Treat an upstream rebase as a separate task.
- `accessibilityIdentifier` values (e.g. `voicesRow_*`, `textInput_*`) are stable surface area — keep them through refactors.
- Animations route through `appAnimation` / `AppLaunchConfiguration.performAnimated` (honor Reduced Motion); Liquid Glass surfaces fall back to solid fills under Reduce Transparency. Both non-negotiable.
- Don't reintroduce a Python backend, a standalone CLI, or bundled model weights. Keep macOS artifacts named `Vocello.app` / `Vocello-macos26.dmg`.
- **Maintainer privacy:** never commit personal identifiers into user-facing files (this file, `README.md`, `website/`, `docs/`, release notes, script defaults) — no legal names, personal emails, home paths (`/Users/<name>/…`), device nicknames, UDIDs, or hardcoded Apple team IDs. Bundle IDs (`com.patricedery.vocello`) and generic "Developer ID" / "notarized" wording are fine. Scan before committing.
