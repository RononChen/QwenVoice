# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

**Vocello** (repo: QwenVoice; macOS app module still `QwenVoice`, iOS app module
`QVoiceiOS`) is a local-first, private text-to-speech app for Apple Silicon.
It synthesizes speech **on-device** with Qwen3-TTS models accelerated through
**MLX** (native Swift packages — no Python runtime, no bundled weights, no cloud
generation). Models download on demand from Hugging Face after install. Stable
macOS release is **Vocello 2.1.0**; iOS is on-device-capable on `main` but not
yet distributed. Platforms: macOS 26+, iOS 26+, Apple Silicon, Xcode 26, Swift 6.

The repo also ships: a headless macOS CLI (`vocello`, links the engine
in-process), a marketing site (`website/`, React + Vite on Vercel), and Python 3
benchmark/diagnostic scripts (`benchmarks/`, `scripts/*.py`).

## Source of truth

`AGENTS.md` is the canonical, deeper agent guide (architecture, engine
invariants, dependency policy, release process). This file is the Claude Code
operating lens on top of it. When facts disagree, trust in this order:
`Sources/` → `project.yml` → `scripts/` → `.github/workflows/release.yml` →
`AGENTS.md` → other prose. `Sources/Resources/qwenvoice_contract.json` is the
canonical schema for speakers/models/variants/HF revisions. **If you change
something that invalidates a doc, update the doc in the same change.**

## Agent handoff protocol (with Kimi / AGENTS.md)

This repo is worked on by two coding agents. **Claude Code owns `CLAUDE.md`**
(this file); **Kimi owns `AGENTS.md`**. Neither edits the other's owned file. The
shared coordination channel is **`AGENT_HANDOFF.md`** (repo root) — an
append-at-top log each agent writes to when it finishes a session.

- **On pickup** (when told you're taking over from Kimi): read `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`
  from the top down to your most recent `claude-code` entry — everything above it
  is new to you (your topmost entry is your read watermark; no external state
  needed). Action any `Requests for claude-code` items before starting.
- **On handoff** (before ending a session): prepend a new entry to
  `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` using its template — commits, files touched, summary,
  decisions, `Requests for kimi`, open questions. Reference the commit SHA(s);
  commit the file with the work.
- **Never edit `AGENTS.md`.** If a change belongs there, put the exact snippet
  under `Requests for kimi` in your handoff entry for Kimi to apply.

The full contract, protocol, and entry template live at the top of
`AGENT_HANDOFF.md`.

## Hard rules (do not violate)

- **iOS is on-device only. Never use the iOS Simulator** or simulator-only tools
  for iOS UI work — no `xcodebuild -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator…'`, no
  `scripts/ios_sim.sh`, and **no XcodeBuildMCP simulator tools**
  (`build_run_sim`, `snapshot_ui`, `list_sims`, …) or Axiom `simulator-tester`
  for the `VocelloiOS` target. Use `scripts/ios_device.sh` (see Commands). This
  project rule overrides the default simulator workflow.
- **`project.yml` is the Xcode project source of truth.** Never edit
  `QwenVoice.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` directly. Edit `project.yml`, then
  `./scripts/regenerate_project.sh`.
- **Single shippable config: `Release` only.** No `DEBUG` symbol, no
  Debug-vs-Release fork. `build.sh` compiles `-Onone` for the local loop;
  `release.sh` compiles the same config optimized. Debug capabilities are gated
  at runtime by `DebugMode.isEnabled` (`QWENVOICE_DEBUG=1` env, or the hidden
  7-tap version label in Settings → `UserDefaults QwenVoice.DebugModeEnabled`).
  Reserve `#if DEBUG` for test/sim scaffolding only.
- **SPM deps are pinned exact for backend determinism.** Move `mlx-swift` and
  `mlx-swift-lm` **in lockstep** (never one alone); don't float pins without a
  benchmark-gated review on a throwaway branch (`vocello bench` + listening
  pass). MLX is the **only** Qwen3-TTS backend — do not pivot to Core ML.
- **`accessibilityIdentifier` values** (e.g. `voicesRow_*`, `textInput_*`,
  `studioChip_*`) are stable surface area and must survive refactors.
- **App sandbox is disabled** (`Sources/QwenVoice.entitlements`) because MLX
  requires it. Hardened runtime is on for release (`allow-unsigned-memory`,
  `disable-library-validation`); iOS has `increased-memory-limit`.
- **Privacy:** never commit personal identifiers (legal names, emails, home
  paths, device nicknames, UDIDs, hardcoded team IDs) into user-facing files
  (`README.md`, `website/`, `docs/`, release notes). Technical bundle IDs like
  `com.patricedery.vocello` are fine.

### Engine invariants (do not regress)

The full list is in `AGENTS.md` "Critical engine invariants." The ones most
likely to bite: the **prewarm reentrancy gate** (`acquire/releasePrewarmSlot` —
never pair a throwing `try? await acquire` with an unconditional
`defer { release }`); **event streams** (macOS `.unbounded`, iOS
`.bufferingNewest(64)`); **cancellation ownership** (iOS cancel is cooperative
only — discard the result on `Task.isCancelled` so cancelled takes never land in
History; `MLXTTSEngine.generate`'s catch must not rethrow `CancellationError`
early); **per-tier memory** (`NativeMemoryPolicyResolver` — no hard
`Memory.memoryLimit` in production, no Quality→Speed OOM fallback); **decoder
drift** (vendored `Qwen3TTSSpeechTokenizer` uses input-side overlap-and-add);
**XPC event forwarding** drains `engine.events` on `Task.detached(.utility)`, off
`MainActor`.

Telemetry (when `QWENVOICE_DEBUG=1`) writes JSONL under
`~/Library/Application Support/QwenVoice-Debug/diagnostics/`; aggregate with
`scripts/summarize_generation_telemetry.py`. Committed benchmark logs must be
≤256 KB; raw `*.jsonl` is gitignored.

## Architecture (big picture)

Full code-verified map: [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) (modules,
dependency graph, runtime, macOS/iOS request lifecycles, persistence, model
management, telemetry). The summary below is the day-to-day essentials.

Three engine hosts sharing one core:

- **macOS** — engine runs **out-of-process** in an XPC service
  (`QwenVoiceEngineService` / `EngineServiceHost.swift`) for crash isolation and
  memory containment; the app talks to it over XPC via `QwenVoiceNative`.
- **iOS** — engine runs **in-process** (`MLXTTSEngine` via
  `NativeRuntimeFactory`). The old ExtensionKit extension was removed (non-UI
  extensions are Jetsam-capped independently of `increased-memory-limit`).
- **CLI** — `vocello` links the engine frameworks in-process and reuses models
  the app already installed.

Module flow: `QwenVoiceBackendCore` (low-level MLX + audio: model load,
synthesis, codecs) → `QwenVoiceCore` (`TTSEngine`, `MLXTTSEngine`,
`TTSEngineError`, `GenerationMode`, audio prep) → platform hosts above.
`SharedSupport/` is the dual-platform UI share point (player view model,
transcriber, reference-clip recorder, language detector). Generation flows
through coordinators: macOS `Sources/ViewModels/`
(`CustomVoiceCoordinator`, `VoiceDesignCoordinator`, `VoiceCloningCoordinator`);
iOS `Sources/iOS/Studio/` (`StudioGenerationCoordinator`,
`IOSBatchGenerationCoordinator`). Engine selection is a single option
(`AppEngineSelection.current()` → `.native` everywhere); platform differences
are enforced by the runtime factory + the XPC/in-process split.

Three generation modes: **Custom Voice** (built-in Qwen3 speakers + delivery
prompt), **Voice Design** (natural-language voice brief), **Voice Cloning**
(reference clip). Models: Qwen3-TTS 1.7B in **Speed (4-bit)** / **Quality
(8-bit)**.

## Claude Code tool, skill & MCP routing

Reach for the **Bash scripts above first** for build/run/test — they encode the
single-config, deterministic local loop. Then:

- **MLX / backend / `QwenVoiceBackendCore` work** → `mlx-swift` + `mlx-swift-lm`
  skills, and read `docs/reference/{mlx-guide,qwen3-tts-guide,mimi-codec-guide,
  metal-guide}.md` before touching `MLXArray`/`Memory`/`GPU`, prompt
  construction, or the vendored codec.
- **Apple framework APIs / iOS 26 / post-cutoff APIs** → `sosumi`
  (`searchAppleDocumentation` / `fetchAppleDocumentation`) + `axiom-apple-docs`
  / `axiom-swiftui` skills. **Library/framework/SDK/CLI docs (non-Apple)** →
  `context7` (resolve-library-id → query-docs) per the global rule.
- **macOS build/run/inspect** → the Bash scripts, or `XcodeBuildMCP` for a quick
  check (macOS scheme `QwenVoice`). `XcodeBuildMCP` simulator tools are
  **off-limits for iOS** (on-device rule).
- **Process / planning** → Superpowers: `brainstorming` before creative/feature
  work, `systematic-debugging` for any bug/test failure, `writing-plans` /
  `executing-plans`, `verification-before-completion` before claiming done,
  `requesting-code-review` / `finishing-a-development-branch`,
  `using-git-worktrees` for isolation.
- **Review & audits** → `/code-review`, `/security-review`, `/simplify`, and
  Axiom auditors (`concurrency-auditor`, `memory-auditor`,
  `swift-performance-analyzer`, `swiftui-{architecture,layout,nav,performance}-auditor`,
  `codable-auditor`, `security-privacy-scanner`, `accessibility-auditor`,
  `energy-auditor`, `liquid-glass-auditor`).
- **Crash logs (.ips / MetricKit / .crash)** → `axiom:crash-analyzer` agent /
  `xcsym` (via `axiom-tools`). **Profiling** → `axiom:performance-profiler` /
  `xcprof`. **Build/environment failures** → `axiom:build-fixer` (but inspect
  the relevant `scripts/*.sh` output via Bash first).
- **GitHub** (issues/PRs/releases/remote search) → `mcp__github__*`; `gh`/`git`
  via Bash for local-only ops. **Hugging Face** (model revisions/downloads) →
  `hf` CLI via Bash + `huggingface-skills`. **Marketing site (`website/`)** →
  `chrome-devtools-mcp` for browser verification + `npm --prefix website`.

## Conventions quick-reference

- Animations route through `appAnimation` / `AppLaunchConfiguration.performAnimated`
  (honor Reduce Motion). Liquid Glass surfaces fall back to solid fills under
  Reduce Transparency. No color-only signal — mode colors always pair with an
  icon/label/position cue.
- iOS vertical scroll surfaces use `IOSScrollView` (not raw `ScrollView`) — it
  bundles no-rubber-band, custom indicator, and the bottom fade that keeps
  content clear of the TabDock. Pass `bottomFadeHeight: 0` for sheets above the dock.
- There is no formatter/linter; **the build is the typecheck.** Follow existing
  Swift style; keep minimal changes and preserve module boundaries. Vendored
  patches under `third_party_patches/mlx-audio-swift/` are allowed when the fix
  belongs below `QwenVoiceCore` — keep them small and upstream-styled.
- Branch hygiene: once a PR merges into `main`, delete the remote feature branch
  immediately and fast-forward/remove the local branch. Don't leave stale merged
  branches on `origin`.
