# Project health scorecard

> Generated inventory and evidence-freshness snapshot. It is not a release verdict and does not
> execute models, devices, UI tests, signing, or network checks.

- Current source identity and dirty state: local JSON report only (kept out of the tracked snapshot to avoid self-referential drift)
- Swift tests: 391 cases in 54 files
- Python tests: 630 cases in 46 files
- Required-step assurance: 55 steps across 12 workflows, all covered by forced-failure fixtures
- Unsafe-concurrency annotations: 50 (50 registered with owner and invariant; contract complete)

## Canonical hardware evidence

| macos | `macos-xcui-benchmark-20260716-181853-b4c2e299` | 2026-07-16T18:35:18Z |
| ios | `ios-xcui-benchmark-20260716-184106-48e3a3a6` | 2026-07-16T19:00:05Z |

## Interpretation

- `stale` means a production path owned by that domain changed after the latest canonical hardware record; it does not block ordinary development publishing.
- Test inventory proves discoverable direct coverage, not that those tests passed in this invocation.
- Dependency age and open P0/P1 issue state require authoritative online sources and are intentionally not guessed offline.
- Run `python3 scripts/project_health.py report --output build/artifacts/project-health/` for the complete local JSON inventory.
