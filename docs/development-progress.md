## Current implementation

- Native app UI acceptance uses one shared XCUITest stack: `macos smoke|benchmark` on the native
  Mac host and `ios smoke|benchmark` on a paired physical iPhone.
- UI execution is explicit frontend QA. It is not required to commit, push, open or merge a pull
  request, run ordinary CI, package a release, or create an iOS archive.
- Headless iOS generation, language, profiling, crash, and memory diagnostics use
  `IOSDeviceDiagnosticsRunner` through `scripts/ios_device.sh`. This is a non-UI diagnostic lane,
  not a second app driver.
- The iOS diagnostic Clone path requires the exact prepared voice ID. The canonical fixture is a
  transcript-backed Voice Design reference; a Custom Voice output is not an acceptable substitute.
- No preview/browser-mirror route, invisible accessibility state marker, alternate UI driver,
  coordinate bridge, or hidden UI bootstrap belongs in the shippable app.
- Model delivery uses one shared integrity/atomic-install implementation. iPhone now owns one
  bundle-aware app-lifetime background session plus an atomic schema-v2 request ledger, exact task
  adoption, cancellation barriers, durable delegate staging, and bounded privacy-safe diagnostics.
  macOS and CLI retain foreground delivery with terminal session teardown. Cancel discards staging;
  Retry reuses verified files. The isolated `scripts/ui_test.sh ios model-download` lifecycle proof
  is explicit QA and never joins smoke, benchmark, CI, packaging, or release gates. The 2026-07-14
  isolated Custom Speed proofs passed on both canonical platforms: macOS verified and removed its
  temporary 2.31 GB install, while the physical-iPhone test preserved monotonic progress across
  backgrounding, termination, and relaunch, installed with exact wire bytes and no retry, then
  deleted the isolated model through visible Settings. No connection or chunking default changed.
- Benchmark evidence now uses collision-resistant run IDs, atomic run-scoped manifests, and a
  privacy-safe PASS-only registry. `benchmarks/HISTORY.md` is generated from canonical JSON records;
  raw telemetry, audio, screenshots, traces, and `.xcresult` bundles remain untracked.
- The canonical comparison hardware is the Mac mini `Mac14,3` (Apple M2, 8 GB) and iPhone 17 Pro
  `iPhone18,1`. Filtered runs are focused, dirty runs exploratory, and Instruments runs
  instrumented; those classes are not silently mixed into canonical timing trends.
- Generation telemetry schema v8 plus benchmark-evidence manifest v2 make RAM/pressure evidence a
  publication contract rather than optional summary data. Exact run-scoped sample sidecars carry
  start/periodic/boundary/stop samples and absolute uptime; summary counts must match, capture
  failures must be zero, and sampler coverage must be at least 95%. Critical pressure, app memory
  warnings/exits, `hardTrim`, and `fullUnload` fail publication; guarded pressure, `softTrim`, and
  95–<100% coverage are explicit warnings. macOS totals pair app and engine samples by uptime rather
  than adding independent maxima.
- CPU and memory Instruments lanes use exact-PID attachment. `profile --kind memory` records CPU
  Profiler, Allocations, VM Tracker, and `os_signpost` together; publication requires target-PID
  rows from every exportable memory schema and labels a configured but non-exportable track
  explicitly instead of claiming row verification. The separate `memory` lane runs the versioned retained-memory sequence and
  publishes `memory-qualification` only when within-mode retained-take growth stays within policy. The iOS
  `memory-field-report` command reads already-pulled,
  privacy-reduced delayed MetricKit summaries only; absence is `notYetDelivered`, not failure.
- Raw Instruments documents are diagnostic, not durable benchmark history. Successful profiles
  publish their validated digest/settings/extracted summary and then discard the raw trace unless
  `--keep-trace` was explicit. Routine cleanup also bounds failed profiles, superseded XCUITest
  results, and scratch DerivedData while preserving the current app, canonical caches, dSYMs, and
  external models. Benchmark results without a valid registry record remain available for
  idempotent publication repair; compile-safety scratch builds use only
  `build/scratch/derived-data/` and self-remove on exit.
- Generated output is classified by `config/build-output-policy.json`: two persistent platform
  Xcode caches, one shared package checkout, ephemeral scratch builds, bounded evidence/current
  symbols, and release-only `build/dist/` outputs. Public `build/Vocello.app` and `build/vocello`
  paths are symlinks to canonical macOS products; local macOS products are arm64-only.
- The telemetry-overhead observer-effect diagnostic keeps its verdict under
  `build/artifacts/macos/` and does
  not publish schema-v2 history. Its `off` lane deliberately constructs no sampler, so requiring
  in-process memory evidence there would change the experiment rather than qualify it.
- A clean canonical macOS schema-v2 baseline exists, and so does the clean canonical iPhone
  schema-v2 baseline: the 29-take Mac mini M2 8 GB run at source commit `4e05f6fd…` and the
  29-take iPhone 17 Pro run at source commit `6ffdbfdd…` passed with the allowed
  `memory.pressure.soft_trim` warning and are preserved in the tracked registry. Earlier dirty
  schema-v2 records remain exploratory and are excluded from canonical trends.
- The physical-iPhone language lane predeclares a one-based, fixed-seed run plan; retains only the
  exact selected WAV and telemetry evidence; requires three-pass locale-locked on-device Speech
  consensus; and offers a retry-free 15-take diagnostic cohort that never publishes history. Its
  version-2 corpus uses at least 15 normalized words per alphabetic script and 24 normalized
  characters per CJK script, pins Design to the known language, and records language-appropriate
  Custom speakers where the Qwen contract supplies one. Custom pinned/Auto pairs test hint
  equivalence, while the three Speech passes test recognizer reproducibility; neither is counted as
  independent audio evidence.

## Publishing boundary

Routine verification is deterministic:

```sh
./scripts/check_project_inputs.sh
scripts/macos_test.sh test
./scripts/build.sh build
./scripts/build_foundation_targets.sh ios
```

Stop there for ordinary development publishing. A model download, paired phone, or UI result is
required only for the explicit quality task that needs it. Audio promotion quality is decided by
deterministic QC, fixed-seed evidence, ASR/prosody gates, and telemetry; listening is optional
annotation rather than a prerequisite.

## Explicit frontend acceptance

```sh
scripts/ui_test.sh macos smoke
scripts/ui_test.sh macos benchmark

scripts/ios_device.sh preflight
scripts/ui_test.sh ios smoke
scripts/ui_test.sh ios benchmark
```

Generation UI tests visibly require Custom, Design, and Clone Speed to be ready, Generate to be
enabled, and the prepared Clone voice to exist before the first take. Use `models ensure` only as an
explicit macOS fixture repair/bootstrap step.

## Open release work

- macOS 2.1.0 is released.
- The optional CI `archive-ios` lane is implemented. Public iOS distribution still requires
  maintainer-owned distribution credentials, the App Store Connect record and metadata, screenshots,
  and submission.
- The 2026-07-14 attended Speech-asset bootstrap resolved and installed the supported DE/ES/JA/ZH
  DictationTranscriber modules, and fresh `SFSpeechRecognizer` instances passed Vocello's legacy
  on-device gate. The clean seven-cell EN/FR quick language record is tracked. The first post-asset
  full attempt passed the 19/19 hint gate but failed the output gate; it correctly published no
  history. That run exposed an out-of-range language-score producer bug plus genuine accuracy
  failures under the original short corpus. The strict validator, version-2 corpus/matrix, and
  CJK-aware punctuation pause budget subsequently passed a retry-free six-cell DE/ZH/JA diagnostic
  cohort with 6/6 hint/QC and 6/6 output checks. That bounded local diagnostic intentionally
  published no history. The first clean corpus-v2 full attempt then passed all 19 hint/QC checks
  but stopped at 13/18 output cells, correctly publishing no history; its failures were isolated to
  French Custom and the three German paths. Revised natural French and German scripts passed four
  retry-free exact-canonical-seed cohorts with strict QC and all 6/6 output checks. The subsequent
  full run `ios-lang-bench-20260714-153252-d2a3eea5` was intentionally interrupted while take 7
  was launching after six takes had completed. It produced no final hint/output gates and no
  history record, so it is non-authoritative local evidence and must not be resumed or published.
  A future session must start a fresh 19-cell, 18-output physical-iPhone acceptance run from the
  committed corpus at or after checkpoint `eaf9d751`.
- Clean canonical macOS and iPhone schema-v2 UI baselines are complete. Rerun either canonical
  matrix after a relevant engine, model, compiler, toolchain, or performance change rather than for
  documentation-only revisions. Explicit quality runs remain independent from ordinary publishing
  and release packaging.
- Physical-iPhone telemetry-v8/evidence-v2 acceptance is complete for the canonical UI matrix,
  retained-memory qualification, and an exact-PID memory profile. The tracked records remain bound
  to their exact source, toolchain, model, and hardware identities; new product changes require
  proportionate fresh evidence rather than reuse of local raw artifacts.

## Resume rule

Review `git status`, read the applicable role playbook, and run verification proportional to the
change. Do not rely on a dated local `.xcresult`, telemetry directory, or device state as proof for a
new checkout. A tracked record proves only its exact source/toolchain/model/hardware identities;
produce fresh evidence only when that acceptance surface is explicitly requested.
