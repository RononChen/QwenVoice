## Current implementation

- Native app UI acceptance uses one shared XCUITest stack: `macos smoke|benchmark` on the native
  Mac host and `ios smoke|benchmark` on a paired physical iPhone.
- UI execution is explicit frontend QA. It is not required to commit, push, open or merge a pull
  request, run ordinary CI, package a release, or create an iOS archive.
- Headless iOS generation, language, profiling, crash, and memory diagnostics use
  `IOSDeviceDiagnosticsRunner` through `scripts/ios_device.sh`. This is a non-UI diagnostic lane,
  not a second app driver.
- The iOS diagnostic Clone path requires the exact prepared voice ID. The canonical fixture is a
  transcript-backed Voice Design reference; a Custom Voice output is not an acceptable substitute.
- No preview/browser-mirror route, invisible accessibility state marker, alternate UI driver,
  coordinate bridge, or hidden UI bootstrap belongs in the shippable app.

## Publishing boundary

Routine verification is deterministic:

```sh
./scripts/check_project_inputs.sh
scripts/macos_test.sh test
./scripts/build.sh build
./scripts/build_foundation_targets.sh ios
```

Stop there for ordinary development publishing. A model download, paired phone, UI result, or
listening pass is required only for the explicit quality task that needs it.

## Explicit frontend acceptance

```sh
scripts/ui_test.sh macos smoke
scripts/ui_test.sh macos benchmark

scripts/ios_device.sh preflight
scripts/ui_test.sh ios smoke
scripts/ui_test.sh ios benchmark
```

Generation UI tests visibly require Custom, Design, and Clone Speed to be ready, Generate to be
enabled, and the prepared Clone voice to exist before the first take. Use `models ensure` only as an
explicit macOS fixture repair/bootstrap step.

## Open release work

- macOS 2.1.0 is released.
- The optional CI `archive-ios` lane is implemented. Public iOS distribution still requires
  maintainer-owned distribution credentials, the App Store Connect record and metadata, screenshots,
  and submission.
- Locale-locked iOS language-output verification depends on the corresponding on-device Speech
  assets; rerun the full language matrix when those assets or language behavior changes.

## Resume rule

Review `git status`, read the applicable role playbook, and run verification proportional to the
change. Do not rely on a dated local `.xcresult`, telemetry directory, or device state as proof for a
new checkout; produce fresh evidence only when that acceptance surface is explicitly requested.
