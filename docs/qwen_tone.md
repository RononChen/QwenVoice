# Tone and Emotion in Vocello

_Last reviewed: 2026-06-11 (deep-research refresh: official Qwen3-TTS guidance + measured instruct-adherence findings folded in)._

This guide is a supplemental prompt-writing reference for the shipped macOS app. It is supplemental and may lag shipped behavior — when in doubt, trust the sources listed below before this guide.

## What the App Exposes

Vocello controls tone and emotion through natural-language instructions, not SSML and not explicit sampling sliders.

Current app behavior:

- **Custom Voice** uses one of the shipped speakers plus an optional delivery instruction prompt
- **Voice Design** has its own generation screen and prompt flow using a natural-language voice/design instruction
- **Voice Cloning** uses reference audio and can optionally use a transcript for better preparation quality, but it does not expose a separate instruction-only tone surface
- single generations produce a complete final take, and the app does not expose temperature or max-token controls
- **Neutral** delivery is intentionally treated as no meaningful style instruction. Custom Voice and Voice Design prompts use direct natural language rather than `Delivery style:` fields.

Useful instruction patterns:

- emotional delivery: `calm and reassuring`, `frustrated but controlled`, `nervous and unsure`
- vocal behavior: `gentle smile in the voice`, `sharp emphasis without shouting`, `breathy but clear`
- pacing and cadence: `slow, deliberate pace`, `quick but clear`, `measured pauses`
- character and timbre: `warm documentary narrator`, `dry late-night radio host`, `soft-spoken teacher`

## Practical Guidance

- Be specific: combine voice character, emotional state, pacing, and clarity in one instruction.
- Be multidimensional (the official instruction-writing principle): combine **emotion + pace + pitch + timbre** rather than a single dimension — `bright energy and a slightly lifted pitch` beats `happy`.
- Keep requests concrete: `calm middle-aged narrator with steady pacing` works better than `make it better`. Measured adherence is highest for concrete acoustic wording and lowest for persona-only briefs ("like a detective") — describe the sound, not just the character.
- Prefer short, direct performance direction over one-word labels; Qwen3-TTS follows natural-language delivery instructions. 1–3 dense sentences is the sweet spot; stacked intensifiers (`very, very deep`) do nothing.
- **Voice Design briefs especially: name the gender and a concrete pitch register.** Voice Design invents a brand-new voice each call (no fixed speaker), so an under-specified brief lets it sample a higher or different-gender voice — a gender-less `deep narrator` can come out high-pitched. Write `a deep, low-pitched male narrator, bass-resonant` rather than `deep narrator`.
- **Negative constraints work and are officially endorsed**: high-arousal instructions like `very happy` can trigger literal laughter — add `but without laughing` / `no added sounds`. The shipped Happy/Excited Strong presets carry this clause.
- Keep strong emotions intelligible: add constraints like `while keeping words clear`, `without shouting`, or `still understandable`.
- For whisper delivery, say `whisper` explicitly. Generic `soft and quiet` wording can produce soft-spoken delivery instead of an actual whisper.
- Phrase instructions as **descriptions, not requests**: a conversational instruction ("Could you read this like…") can leak a spoken "OK" acknowledgment into the audio.
- Write the instruction in **English or Chinese** regardless of the output language — those are the trained instruction languages; the spoken-text language is controlled separately (the Language picker / auto-detection).
- **Don't expect dialect or accent switching from instructions** — emotion and style follow, but `speak in a Sichuan dialect` yields standard Mandarin. Dialects come from the dialect speakers (Dylan — Beijing, Eric — Sichuan) or from cloning an accented reference.
- **Speakers carry baked-in delivery biases**: Ryan is inherently expressive and resists a flat newscast read; for neutral delivery start from a calmer voice (Aiden, Serena) instead of fighting the timbre with instructions.
- Iterate wording: instruction following is probabilistic, so small prompt changes can materially change the result.
- Use Voice Design when you want a reusable prompt-driven voice shape, and use Voice Cloning when you want a specific reference identity from audio. (Cloned voices cannot take delivery instructions on the current checkpoints — pick a reference clip that already carries the delivery you want, e.g. by saving a Voice Design result.)
- **Long scripts drift**: very long single generations tend to speed up and compress pauses toward the end. Break long material into paragraph-sized generations (each re-asserts the delivery instruction) for steadier pacing.

## Pauses in the Spoken Text

Qwen3-TTS does not parse SSML or explicit pause markers. Pauses come from the natural punctuation and line structure of the input:

- **Period** — sentence-end pause (longest within a paragraph).
- **Comma / semicolon / colon** — short pause.
- **Blank line** between paragraphs — paragraph-level pause.
- **Question mark / exclamation mark** — sentence-end pause with the matching prosody.

Things that are **not** reliable pause cues:

- Ellipsis (`...`) — read as text, not as a long pause.
- Hyphens or dashes — usually treated as continuation, not pause.
- Repeated commas or extra spaces — collapsed; they don't lengthen the pause.

If you need a longer beat, end the sentence with a period and start a new one. For an explicit paragraph break, add a blank line.

## Examples

Custom Voice:

> Calm, soothing, and reassuring, with smooth pacing and gentle confidence.

Custom Voice, strong emotion:

> Very excited and animated, energetic and anticipatory, with lively emphasis, controlled pacing, and clear pronunciation.

Custom Voice, whisper:

> Subtle audible whisper, close-mic and quiet, with gentle breath, hushed tone, and clear words.

Voice Design:

> A composed documentary narrator with a low, warm voice, deliberate pacing, crisp diction, and gentle emphasis on key phrases.

Voice Cloning support text:

> Use a clean 5–10 second reference clip and include the transcript if possible.
