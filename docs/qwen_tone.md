# Tone and Emotion in QwenVoice

_Last reviewed: 2026-04-20._

This guide is a supplemental prompt-writing reference for the shipped macOS app. It is supplemental and may lag shipped behavior — when in doubt, trust the sources listed below before this guide.

For current repo truth about app structure, workflows, or supported behavior, trust:

2. `docs/reference/current-state.md`
3. `CLAUDE.md` for repository and agent workflow rules

## What the App Exposes

QwenVoice controls tone and emotion through natural-language instructions, not SSML and not explicit sampling sliders.

Current app behavior:

- **Custom Voice** uses one of the shipped English speakers plus an instruction prompt
- **Voice Design** has its own generation screen and prompt flow
- **Voice Cloning** uses reference audio and can optionally use a transcript for better preparation quality, but it does not expose a separate instruction-only tone surface
- single generations stream live preview, but the app does not expose temperature or max-token controls

Useful instruction patterns:

- emotional delivery: `calm and reassuring`, `frustrated but controlled`, `nervous and unsure`
- pacing and cadence: `slow, deliberate pace`, `quick and energetic`, `measured and deliberate`
- character and timbre: `warm documentary narrator`, `dry late-night radio host`, `soft-spoken teacher`

## Practical Guidance

- Be specific: combine voice character, emotional state, and pacing in one instruction.
- Keep requests concrete: `calm middle-aged narrator with steady pacing` works better than `make it better`.
- Iterate wording: instruction following is probabilistic, so small prompt changes can materially change the result.
- Use Voice Design when you want a reusable prompt-driven voice shape, and use Voice Cloning when you want a specific reference identity from audio.

## Pauses in the Spoken Text

Qwen3-TTS does not parse SSML or explicit pause markers. Pauses come from the natural punctuation and line structure of the input:

- **Period** — sentence-end pause (longest within a paragraph).
- **Comma / semicolon / colon** — short pause.
- **Blank line** between paragraphs — paragraph-level pause.
- **Question mark / exclamation mark** — sentence-end pause with the matching prosody.

Things that are **not** reliable pause cues:

- Ellipsis (`...`) — read as text, not as a long pause.
- Hyphens or dashes — usually treated as continuation, not pause.
- Repeated commas or extra spaces — collapsed; they don't lengthen the pause.

If you need a longer beat, end the sentence with a period and start a new one. For an explicit paragraph break, add a blank line.

## Examples

Custom Voice:

> Speak in a calm, slightly tired voice, like someone explaining a long day.

Voice Design:

> A composed documentary narrator with a low, warm voice and deliberate pacing.

Voice Cloning support text:

> Use a clean 5–10 second reference clip and include the transcript if possible.
