# Privacy And Local Storage

QwenVoice/Vocello is local-first. Prompts, recorded or imported reference clips, transcripts, saved voices, generated audio, model files, and history stay on the user's device unless the user explicitly exports, shares, or uploads them elsewhere.

## macOS Storage

Installed/public macOS Release app support root:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/QwenVoice/
```

Debug builds use a separate persistent development root so models, saved voices, outputs, and `history.sqlite` survive rebuilds:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/QwenVoice-Debug/
```

With the `QWENVOICE_DEBUG` master gate enabled, the macOS app also honors this hermetic diagnostic
override; shipped production behavior ignores it:

```sh
QWENVOICE_APP_SUPPORT_DIR=/path/to/custom/app-support
```

Maintained macOS subtrees and preferences:

- `models/` stores installed Hugging Face model files. Speed and Quality folders for the same
  generation mode can coexist on macOS. Catalog-v2 installs may also use the hidden
  `.qwenvoice-components-v1/` content-addressed store; ordinary model paths remain regular hard
  links, and component liveness is derived from strict installed manifests.
- `.qwenvoice-downloads/` stores staged model downloads, partial files, resume data, and download-state metadata while a download is in progress.
- `diagnostics/model-downloads/` stores allowlisted transfer/failure summaries, capped at 20 records and 5 MB; raw URLs and absolute paths are excluded.
- `outputs/CustomVoice/`, `outputs/VoiceDesign/`, and `outputs/Clones/` store generated audio unless the user chooses a different output directory. If a user-chosen directory becomes missing or unwritable, new audio falls back to these default folders and Settings shows a warning — a generation is never lost to a vanished folder.
- `voices/` stores saved voice reference assets (the reference WAV plus an optional `.txt` transcript sidecar).
- Reference-clip **recording** (macOS, 2026-06) uses two short-lived directories under the system temporary directory: `voice-clone-references/` holds the in-progress capture and `voice-enroll/` holds a stable copy during enrollment. Both are deleted as part of enrollment/cancel; the kept copy is the one in `voices/`.
- `history.sqlite` stores local generation history. Database initialization, migration, read,
  write, or delete failures are typed and fail closed: the UI shows a degraded state and disables
  destructive history actions instead of presenting an unavailable database as empty. macOS retries
  on reload or re-entry; it does not currently expose a dedicated Retry button.
- Active macOS model-quality choices are stored in app preferences, keyed per generation mode. `DebugMode` isolates preferences to `com.qwenvoice.app.debug`; Release builds use `UserDefaults.standard`.

Delete local macOS app data by quitting the app and removing the app support root or the specific
subtree above. Use the model manager for an individual model so shared components still referenced
by another installed manifest remain valid. Deleting the whole `models/` root removes both model
folders and the component store and requires downloading them again; it does not by itself clear
normal app preferences such as the active model-quality choice.

## iPhone Storage

The iPhone app uses the App Group:

```text
group.com.patricedery.vocello.shared
```

Its shared container is rooted under the app-owned `Vocello` subtree and is managed by `Sources/iOSSupport/Services/AppPaths.swift`.

The May 2026 iOS identity rename moved pre-release storage from the old QVoice App Group to this Vocello App Group without migration, so device builds after the rename start with fresh iPhone data.

With the `QWENVOICE_DEBUG` master gate enabled, the iPhone app also honors this hermetic diagnostic
override; shipped production behavior ignores it:

```sh
QVOICE_APP_SUPPORT_DIR=/path/to/custom/app-support
```

For physical-device XCUITest, a single safe relative component such as
`model-download-acceptance` resolves beneath the app's managed Application Support root. Path
separators and traversal components are rejected. That managed leaf also receives a stable,
one-way-digested background-session identity distinct from production; the leaf and any absolute
diagnostic path are never disclosed in the identifier. Production uses the App Group container and
its historical bundle-scoped background-session identifier when the debug master gate is absent.

Maintained iPhone subtrees:

- `models/` stores verified installed model files plus the hidden catalog-v2
  `.qwenvoice-components-v1/` content-addressed store. Model-visible component paths are regular
  hard links; deletion preserves blobs still live in another strict installed manifest.
- `downloads/ios_model_delivery_state.json` is the atomic schema-v2 delivery ledger. It stores only privacy-safe identifiers, relative paths, receipts, retry counts, byte progress, and terminal state.
- `downloads/staging/` is the only iPhone delivery staging tree; it holds durable delegate files plus per-model verified files, partials, and resume data.
- `diagnostics/model-downloads/` stores allowlisted local transfer/failure summaries, capped at 20 records and 5 MB. It excludes raw URLs, absolute paths, device identity, and user data.
- `outputs/` stores generated audio. The user can optionally also copy each new clip to an external Files/iCloud folder via Settings → "Saved outputs" (a user-granted security-scoped bookmark; no new entitlement). The internal copy here is always kept and is what History plays from.
- `voices/` stores saved voice reference assets.
- `cache/imported_references/` stores app-owned materializations of WAV, MP3, AIFF, or M4A files
  selected or opened through Files, plus an adjacent `.txt` sidecar when supplied. Enrollment copies
  the kept reference into `voices/`.
- Other `cache/` subtrees store required runtime cache data.
- `history.sqlite` stores local generation history. Database initialization, migration, read,
  write, or delete failures are typed and fail closed: the UI shows a degraded state with a visible
  Retry action and disables destructive history actions instead of presenting an unavailable database
  as empty.

The iPhone app intentionally keeps shared state constrained to the App Group app-support subtree. It does not use a parallel shared-user-defaults channel for model or voice state.

## Voice Cloning Consent

Voice cloning accepts user-provided reference audio — recorded in the app or imported through the
native Files picker/document-open route. Only clone voices you own or have permission to use.
Reference clips, transcripts, and saved voices are local files, but the user remains responsible for
rights and consent before recording, importing, or reusing them.

Both apps expose the genuine `voiceCloning_consentAcknowledgment` control in Settings and keep
Clone Generate disabled until it is enabled. The choice is stored locally as
`vocello.voiceCloningConsent.v1`; it is not telemetry or an upload. A transcript is optional:
transcript-backed conditioning uses the supplied text, while a clip without text uses the distinct
audio-only x-vector path. Those modes have separate cache/artifact identities.

## Microphone And On-Device Transcription

Recording a reference clip uses the **Microphone** permission; transcript auto-fill uses **Speech Recognition**. Both are requested on first use, and recognition always runs with `requiresOnDeviceRecognition` — the audio is never sent to Apple or any server, on macOS or iPhone. Transcripts are stored only as the local `.txt` sidecar next to the voice's WAV. On macOS, transcription additionally requires Siri to be enabled (an OS gate — the system silently refuses speech-recognition authorization otherwise); the app detects this and links the relevant System Settings panes. Full permission model: [`macos-permissions.md`](macos-permissions.md).

## Diagnostics

Diagnostics should be user-initiated. The app may write local logs or exportable diagnostic files for model download, generation, playback, XPC, and model-admission failures, but it should not report those details over the network automatically.

When runtime telemetry is explicitly enabled, `generation-failures.jsonl` is a privacy-reduced
schema-v2 support log capped at 200 entries and 256 KiB. It stores only an allowlisted error code
and classification, known lifecycle stage and model identifier, generation mode, text length,
streaming flag, and timestamp. It never stores prompts, transcripts, voice descriptions, paths,
URLs, reflected/localized errors, stack symbols, credentials, email addresses, or arbitrary
metadata. The logger exposes a local clear operation; it never uploads the file.

Repository-local build and QA state lives under the ignored `build/` tree. Its machine-readable
contract is `config/build-output-policy.json`; `scripts/build_output_policy.py validate` rejects an
unowned root or a tracked command that bypasses the contract.

Persisted Codex task/session state is separate user-scoped developer-tool data, not Vocello app
data or repository build output. Its optional inventory and explicitly approved cleanup process is
documented in [`codex-session-storage.md`](codex-session-storage.md); live manifests, identifiers,
and journals remain temporary and untracked.

The table below is rendered from the manifest by
`python3 scripts/build_output_policy.py status --markdown`. Policy validation compares the marked
block byte-for-byte, so a manifest change cannot silently leave documentation stale.

### External Xcode components are not repository cache

Repository inventory and cleanup own only the paths declared by
`config/build-output-policy.json`. They never delete, download, install, or manage Xcode Platform
Support, CoreSimulator runtime components, or global Xcode DerivedData. Removing all compatible iOS
runtime components can make `generic/platform=iOS` unavailable on current Xcode 26 toolchains even
while `xcodebuild -showsdks` still lists `iphoneos`. That state is an external toolchain issue, not
reclaimable repository output. Use `scripts/lib/ios_platform_preflight.py check`, then make any
multi-gigabyte component installation explicitly through Xcode Settings.

The public `build/Vocello.app` and `build/vocello` paths are manifest-owned symlinks to the current
canonical macOS products; they are not independent application or CLI copies.

Every Xcode invocation supplies an explicit DerivedData and cloned-package path. Local macOS outputs
are arm64-only. XcodeBuildMCP uses its own managed scratch DerivedData and never becomes a third
persistent cache. Xcode GUI DerivedData outside the repository is report-only; cleanup touches it
only through `--external-xcode --yes` after exact project matching.

`project.yml` remains the source of truth for the CLI and app-host-free iOS logic-test targets.
XcodeGen 2.45.4 cannot directly emit their shared schemes, so `scripts/regenerate_project.sh`
follows XcodeGen with two narrow renderers: `scripts/generate_cli_scheme.py` and
`scripts/generate_ios_logic_scheme.py`. They substitute generated target identifiers into the
checked-in `VocelloCLI` and `VocelloiOSLogic` templates; project-input validation rejects a missing
or stale result. Supported commands therefore use explicit schemes and managed DerivedData rather
than leaking state through scheme-less `-target` invocations.

Exact-PID Allocations traces can grow by multiple gigabytes during one cold model run, so successful
profiles publish compact evidence and discard the raw trace unless `--keep-trace` is explicit. Use
`scripts/clean_build_caches.sh` for a read-only inventory and `--routine --dry-run` for the bounded
cleanup preview. Inventory reports filesystem free space, automatically eligible bytes, blocked
evidence, and failed-profile bytes that require explicit acknowledgement. `--routine` removes
eligible scratch while preserving
source, tracked benchmark history, persistent caches, current UUID-matched dSYMs, distribution
outputs, publication-repair evidence, and model stores. `--aggressive` additionally removes
persistent compilation/package caches and the public aliases. `--prune-ui-results` and `--dist`
target only their named class; `--clobber --yes` removes ignored repository-local generated state.
`./scripts/build.sh clean` delegates to bounded aggressive cleanup rather than deleting the whole
tree. Model deletion remains a separate explicit `--models` action. UI pruning includes smoke,
benchmark, and model-download lanes: it keeps the latest pass, preserves matching benchmark
publication-repair evidence, and reduces resolved failures or unrepairable unpublished results to
small lifecycle summaries. Legacy/malformed or explicitly pinned results stay blocked. A failed
profile trace is compacted only after a newer same-kind capture resolves it or through the exact,
reviewable command `--compact-profile-failure RUN_ID`. An explicit retention pin always wins.
Compaction keeps the required marker and summary plus at most 8 MiB of allowlisted auxiliary
diagnostics; each retained log is capped at 1 MiB. Copied or misrouted public app/CLI products make
selective or aggressive cache cleanup fail closed instead of deleting the unexpected product.

Persistent caches are independently selectable:

```sh
scripts/clean_build_caches.sh --cache macos --dry-run
scripts/clean_build_caches.sh --cache ios --dry-run
scripts/clean_build_caches.sh --cache packages --dry-run
scripts/clean_build_caches.sh --cache runtime --dry-run
```

Heavy local lanes read their minimum free-space requirement and cleanup hint from the same manifest.
They fail before regeneration, compilation, target launch, or evidence creation when the floor is
not met. Profile tracer stages retain their 5 GiB CPU and 15 GiB memory checks; their prerequisite
macOS/iOS builds still require 8 GiB and 10 GiB respectively, making those the effective full CPU
command floors. No runner
automatically applies a global routine or cache cleanup after success; UI/profile runners only apply
their own validator-safe retention transaction.
