# iOS Device Screen-Mirror Testing

Validate the real iPhone app on owned hardware while controlling the UI through Apple's iPhone Mirroring app. This path covers model downloads, engine-extension behavior, memory guardrail evidence, and real MLX generation once Apple's increased-memory entitlement is available. Simulator review remains covered by [`ios-simulator-testing.md`](ios-simulator-testing.md).

## Quick Start

```sh
scripts/ios_device.sh doctor
scripts/ios_device.sh start
```

`doctor` and `start` first run the user-scoped iOS readiness gate when available and save the raw result as `readiness.json` in the run directory. The gate is the source of truth for physical iPhone availability because it warms CoreDevice, retries `xctrace`, and checks the Xcode destination in order. Do not claim hardware profiling or performance readiness from `devicectl`, `xctrace`, or `xcodebuild -showdestinations` alone.

Readiness status:

- `GREEN`: CoreDevice, `xctrace`, and Xcode destinations agree. Real physical-device testing and profiling are allowed when the run itself succeeds.
- `AMBER`: CoreDevice can see or warm the phone, but `xctrace` or Xcode destination readiness is incomplete. Install/run checks may continue, but Instruments/xctrace profiling and physical performance claims are blocked.
- `RED` / `NO_DEVICE`: `start` stops before build/install. Simulator and local macOS results are not proof for physical iPhone RAM or performance.
- `UNAVAILABLE`: Patrice's user-scoped gate is missing, so the script falls back to legacy checks for public repo users. Treat the output as install/run preflight only, not profiling proof.

`start` creates a focused evidence bundle under `build/Debug/ios-device/runs/<utc-run-id>/`, builds `VocelloiOS` Debug for the paired physical iPhone, installs it with CoreDevice, launches `com.patricedery.vocello` with lightweight native telemetry enabled, and opens iPhone Mirroring.

Defaults:

- device: the paired physical iPhone 17 Pro, currently `iPhone de Patrice`
- build: Debug, direct install, automatic signing
- catalog: bundled production iPhone catalog, with 0.6B Custom/Clone and 1.7B Design artifacts downloaded from pinned Hugging Face revisions
- signing team resolution: `QVOICE_IOS_TEAM_ID`, `QWENVOICE_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, then `FK2D8X36G2`
- app data: preserved across runs unless you manually uninstall or clear the app; the May 2026 identity rename intentionally reset pre-release data by moving to `group.com.patricedery.vocello.shared`
- proactive iPhone prefetch: disabled by default; explicit generation owns model load/warm work

Useful overrides:

```sh
scripts/ios_device.sh start --device <device-id-or-udid>
scripts/ios_device.sh start --run-id memory-guard-custom
scripts/ios_device.sh start --catalog-url https://example.com/ios/catalog/v1/models.json
scripts/ios_device.sh start --allowed-hosts downloads.example.com,cdn.example.com
scripts/ios_device.sh start --enable-proactive-prefetch
scripts/ios_device.sh start --mlx-memory-limit-mb 2800 --mlx-cache-limit-mb 64
```

After a build, inspect the signed app and engine-extension entitlements:

```sh
scripts/ios_device.sh verify-entitlements
scripts/ios_device.sh build --enable-increased-memory-limit
scripts/ios_device.sh verify-entitlements --enable-increased-memory-limit
```

The ordinary Debug path is expected to report the restricted increased-memory entitlement as missing. When `--enable-increased-memory-limit` is used after Apple approval/profile regeneration, both `com.patricedery.vocello` and `com.patricedery.vocello.engine-extension` must report `com.apple.developer.kernel.increased-memory-limit=true`. If either one is false, treat real MLX generation as signing/provisioning-blocked before tuning model memory.

For the full Apple request packet, copy-ready justification, and evidence checklist, see [`ios-increased-memory-entitlement-request.md`](ios-increased-memory-entitlement-request.md).

`--enable-proactive-prefetch` is only for backend experiments. Stable hardware validation keeps it off because ExtensionKit may interrupt idle/prewarm-heavy extension work more aggressively than macOS XPC services.

The same values can be supplied with environment variables for repeatable local runs: `QVOICE_IOS_DEVICE_ID`, `QVOICE_IOS_DEVICE_RUN_ID`, `QVOICE_IOS_MODEL_CATALOG_URL`, `QVOICE_IOS_MODEL_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `QVOICE_IOS_MEMORY_GUARD_FORCE_BAND`, `QVOICE_IOS_MEMORY_GUARD_FORCE_CRITICAL_ONCE`, `QVOICE_IOS_MLX_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB`, and `QVOICE_IOS_MLX_CACHE_LIMIT_MB`. `scripts/ios_device.sh start` sets `QWENVOICE_NATIVE_TELEMETRY_MODE=lightweight` for Debug evidence capture.

`QVOICE_IOS_MLX_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB` is a process-lifetime Debug experiment for the launched app/extension process. Relaunch the app with a different value when sweeping limits.

## Codex Control

iPhone Mirroring exposes a visual Mac window, not the app's iOS accessibility identifiers. Use Computer Use against the `iPhone Mirroring` / `Recopie de l'iPhone` window by visible labels, tab icons, text fields, and buttons. If focus drifts, run:

```sh
scripts/ios_device.sh mirror
```

Then refresh Computer Use state for the mirroring app and continue. Use screenshots at milestones:

```sh
scripts/ios_device.sh screenshot settings-ready
scripts/ios_device.sh screenshot custom-complete
```

## Smoke Scenarios

Run these from the mirrored iPhone UI after `start`:

- Settings: verify each Speed model row can download or is already installed. First-time runs use the bundled catalog and require normal internet access to Hugging Face artifact URLs.
- Custom Voice: install the Custom model if needed, enter a short prompt, generate, listen briefly, and capture a screenshot after completion.
- Voice Design: enter a short voice brief and prompt, generate, confirm the inline player appears, and capture a screenshot.
- Voice Cloning: record or select a 10-20 second reference, enter a prompt, generate, confirm playback starts, and capture a screenshot.

For memory guardrails, collect one normal run plus the two Debug-only synthetic scenarios:

```sh
scripts/ios_device.sh start --run-id memory-baseline
scripts/ios_device.sh start --run-id guarded-probe --force-band guarded
scripts/ios_device.sh start --run-id critical-once-probe --force-critical-once
```

`--force-band guarded` should block proactive warm/prefetch work while still allowing foreground generation. `--force-critical-once` should cancel the first active generation sample, abort live preview, request a full unload, and disarm until the app is relaunched.

Run the first hardware pass without MLX memory/cache limits. After that baseline is pulled, run the same Custom -> Design -> Clone path with a limit probe:

```sh
scripts/ios_device.sh start --run-id mlx-2800 --mlx-memory-limit-mb 2800 --mlx-cache-limit-mb 64
```

The MLX limit probe is diagnostic only: it sets Debug launch env vars so runaway active allocations fail earlier than jetsam while Release/TestFlight policy remains unchanged.

Physical iOS defaults to final-file playback rather than live chunk playback: inline preview PCM is skipped and Release builds do not publish extension events. To test live debug chunks without inline PCM over XPC, launch with `QVOICE_IOS_EXTENSION_ENABLE_EVENT_SINK=1`, `QWENVOICE_STREAMING_OUTPUT_POLICY=file`, and `QWENVOICE_STREAMING_PREVIEW_DATA=off`.

## Evidence Capture

After each run:

```sh
scripts/ios_device.sh pull
```

The run directory contains:

- `run-manifest.json`, selected device metadata, build/install/launch JSON, and CoreDevice logs
- `readiness.json` with the gate status, CoreDevice identifier, hardware UDID, `xctrace` state, and Xcode destination state when the user-scoped gate is available
- `entitlements-check.json` plus the signed entitlement plists under `entitlements/` after build or `verify-entitlements`
- `screenshots/*.png` captured from the Mac screen
- `pulled/diagnostics/memory-contexts.jsonl`, `pulled/diagnostics/native-events.jsonl`, and `pulled/diagnostics/manifest.json` when the app ran with lightweight telemetry
- app, extension, and combined footprint/headroom fields, implied process-limit fields, and aggregate pressure bands in each memory-context record
- `likelyEntitlementBlocked=true` when the extension snapshot is critical because extension process headroom is below the admission threshold while aggregate device pressure is not critical
- `runtime-load-model-preswitch-cache-clear` native events when an iPhone run switches from one loaded model ID to another before the next load peak
- focused App Group evidence: `history.sqlite`, generated `outputs/`, and saved `voices/`

On Xcode/CoreDevice builds that reject direct `appGroupDataContainer` copies with a path-validation error, `pull` falls back to the Debug-only app-container mirror for memory diagnostics. History/output/voice evidence remains App Group best-effort.

Diagnostics memory records intentionally omit prompt text and audio bytes. The pulled history database and output files are local evidence artifacts for manual review.

To read extension process headroom and the implied per-process limit from pulled diagnostics:

```sh
jq -r '
  select(.engineExtensionImpliedProcessLimitBytes != null)
  | [
      .recordedAt,
      .reason,
      (.engineExtensionPhysFootprintMB | floor),
      (.engineExtensionAvailableHeadroomMB | floor),
      (.engineExtensionImpliedProcessLimitMB | floor),
      .pressureBand,
      .aggregatePressureBand,
      .likelyEntitlementBlocked
    ]
  | @tsv
' build/Debug/ios-device/runs/<run-id>/pulled/diagnostics/memory-contexts.jsonl
```

Read the implied limit as `extension physical footprint + extension os_proc_available_memory() headroom`. It is process headroom for the engine extension, not free RAM on the phone. After Apple grants the increased-memory entitlement and profiles are regenerated, the first entitled baseline should verify that the extension's initial headroom/implied limit increases materially before attempting longer Custom, Design, and Clone runs.

## Recovery

- Device not found or readiness is `RED` / `NO_DEVICE`: unlock the iPhone, keep it on the same network or connected by cable, open Xcode's Devices and Simulators window if needed, and rerun `scripts/ios_device.sh doctor`.
- Mirroring window unavailable: open `/System/Applications/iPhone Mirroring.app` manually once, then rerun `scripts/ios_device.sh mirror`.
- Signing failure: confirm the Apple Developer account for the selected team is available in Xcode Settings, then rerun `scripts/ios_device.sh build`.
- Increased-memory entitlement failure: `scripts/ios_device.sh build --enable-increased-memory-limit` requires Apple approval for `com.apple.developer.kernel.increased-memory-limit` on both the app and engine-extension profiles. Without that entitlement, Debug installs remain useful for UI, downloads, ExtensionKit transport, and diagnostics, but real MLX generation is entitlement-blocked whenever extension headroom is below admission thresholds.
- Model downloads fail: rerun `doctor` and check `catalog-check.stderr` in the run directory. Use `--catalog-url <url>` only when testing a staging catalog override.

This workflow is local-only. TestFlight archive/export remains owned by `scripts/release_ios_testflight.sh`.
