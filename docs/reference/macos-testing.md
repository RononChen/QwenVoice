# macOS testing

Vocello separates routine deterministic development verification from explicit native-app UI
acceptance. XCUITest is the sole autonomous macOS app UI driver.

## Ordinary development

```sh
./scripts/check_project_inputs.sh
scripts/macos_test.sh test
./scripts/build.sh build
```

These checks are sufficient to commit, push, open a pull request, merge ordinary development, and
run ordinary CI. They do not require UI execution, installed generation models, or release
evidence.

## Explicit XCUITest lanes

Run only when frontend acceptance is explicitly requested:

```sh
scripts/ui_test.sh macos smoke
scripts/ui_test.sh macos benchmark
# Filtered benchmark example:
scripts/ui_test.sh macos benchmark --modes custom --lengths short --warm 1 --label "focused"
```

| Lane | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| Smoke | Exact app launch, sidebar navigation, visible model and clone-reference readiness, one real Custom generation, completed player, and History |
| Benchmark | Ordered, configurable Custom/Design/Clone matrix with cold/warm classification and per-take deterministic proof; the default is exactly 29 takes |

The runner targets the configured native Vocello test host. Before launch it resolves every matching
Vocello and engine-service PID to its executable, fails fast if any process belongs to another app
path, and signals only the exact app/service products under the runner's Release build directory.
It uses stable accessibility identifiers and condition waits, leaves preferences and saved voices
unchanged, and records failures as XCTest activities and attachments. It never retries through a
display name or alternate app path.

Benchmark accepts `--modes`, `--lengths`, `--warm`, and `--label`. Filters are explicit diagnostic
runs; invoking the command without filters is the canonical 29-take matrix on the tracked Mac mini
`Mac14,3` / Apple M2 / 8 GB profile. Dirty-source successes are exploratory even on that hardware.

## Model-dependent tests

Before generation, XCUITest must visibly confirm that Custom, Design, and Clone Speed are ready,
Generate is enabled, and the benchmark clone voice is present. Use
`scripts/macos_test.sh models ensure` only to repair/bootstrap fixtures, then begin a fresh test
run. Do not download models implicitly inside a normal UI lane.

## Deterministic evidence retained

The benchmark validator joins UI completion with:

- History/database correlation and a readable WAV;
- audio QC and complete typed frontend/XPC/backend telemetry by `generationID`;
- crash delta and XPC process lifecycle evidence;
- benchmark order, take count, cold/warm class, and timing.

The validator atomically writes an untracked `benchmark-evidence.json` containing only the run's
ordered generation IDs/cells and verdicts. The summarizer consumes that manifest plus the run ID,
never the diagnostics directory's historical population. A PASS publishes one privacy-safe record
under `benchmarks/runs/ui-generation/` and regenerates `benchmarks/HISTORY.md`. Raw telemetry, WAVs,
screenshots, and `.xcresult` remain untracked; publication never stages, commits, or pushes.

New publishable generation runs use telemetry schema v8 and evidence manifest v2. Their exact
`samples-<generationID>.jsonl` files must begin/end with one start/stop sample, contain the required
load/stream/finalization boundaries, match summary counts, have zero capture failures, and retain at
least 95% periodic coverage. macOS UI/XPC totals are calculated only from app and engine samples
paired by absolute uptime within one 500 ms cadence; independent process maxima are never added.
Critical pressure, app memory warning/exit, `hardTrim`, or `fullUnload` fails publication. Guarded
pressure, `softTrim`, or 95–<100% coverage publishes only as an explicit warning.

Smoke is intentionally smaller: it asserts visible completion and History plus the runner's
single-process/crash-delta checks; it does not claim the benchmark's per-take telemetry matrix.

## Instruments profiles

```sh
# CPU/signpost profile (default)
scripts/macos_test.sh profile custom:speed:

# CPU + Allocations + VM Tracker + signposts
scripts/macos_test.sh profile --kind memory custom:speed:

# Explicit diagnostic exception: retain the raw Instruments document.
scripts/macos_test.sh profile --kind memory --keep-trace custom:speed:
```

The memory profile captures one cold long take so Allocations/VM Tracker include model-load and
sustained-generation peaks. It uses Apple's Allocations template, which contains both memory tracks
with automatic VM snapshots disabled; standalone VM Tracker auto-snapshots suspend the target and
would legitimately lower its 500 ms sampler coverage. Publication verifies that setting from the
captured trace and still enforces the unmodified 95% coverage floor. The default 180-second safety
cap accommodates a cold long take, while target exit ends recording early. `scripts/macos_test.sh
memory` owns the repeated retained-growth qualification.

Both commands build the exact CLI, suspend one owned process, attach Instruments to that exact PID,
resume it only after xctrace reports recording, and validate the exported trace table of contents.
The memory lane enables verbose per-sample telemetry and remains PASS-only. Headless CLI profiles
report the owning engine process; XPC UI benchmarks use the uptime-aligned app+engine aggregate.
The runner requires at least 5 GiB free for CPU profiles and 15 GiB for memory profiles before it
launches the target. After successful trace validation and history publication, the raw trace is
deleted by default; the record retains its digest, capture settings, extracted summary, original
ephemeral path, and retention status. `--keep-trace` is the explicit diagnostic exception. A
failure retains only the newest raw failure for that platform/profile kind. Sidecars and retained
diagnostics remain under `build/` and untracked.

Retained-memory qualification is a distinct non-Instruments lane:

```sh
scripts/macos_test.sh memory --label retained-check
```

It runs the policy-owned Custom→Design→Clone Speed/medium sequence with three canonically named
`retained#0...2` takes per mode (plus the CLI's genuine Custom/Design cold takes) in one process.
Those retained takes still report their actual engine warm state. Policy
`retained-memory-v1` compares the first and last completed retained-take footprint within each mode;
the maximum positive growth must stay at or below 5% of physical RAM. Intended cross-mode model
residency is diagnostic and is not mislabeled as a leak. A PASS creates a
`memory-qualification` record; a generation, memory, QC, or retention failure leaves only local
artifacts.

## Generated-output ownership

macOS development and UI lanes reuse only `build/cache/xcode/macos/`; shared package checkouts live
under `build/cache/xcode/source-packages/`. Result bundles, diagnostics, profiles, and current dSYMs
are untracked artifacts under `build/artifacts/`, while release packaging is isolated under
`build/scratch/derived-data/release-macos/` and `build/dist/macos/`. `build/Vocello.app` and
`build/vocello` are public symlinks to current canonical products, not copied applications. See the
authoritative owner/lifetime table in [`privacy-storage.md`](privacy-storage.md).

## Release boundary

macOS signing, notarization, and packaging use deterministic release-readiness checks. Smoke and
benchmark XCUITest results are independent frontend QA artifacts and never a packaging prerequisite.
