# Testing Overview

Vocello's behavioral testing surface is local-only and three-layered. This doc names the layers, explains what each one catches (and misses), and tells you which to run when a given piece of code changes.

## The three layers

| Layer | Question it answers | Wall-clock | Tooling |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Functional smoke** | Did the generate path produce a WAV + DB row? | ~1 min per scenario | [`smoke-*.md`](.) runbooks, `scripts/uitest.sh smoke-check / reset / prep / verify-generation` |
| **Timing bench** | Is the latency, RTF, RMS, peak, and memory within ±15 % of the committed baseline across cold/warm × variant × prompt-length? | ~12 min per mode (24 samples) | [`bench-*.md`](.) runbooks, `scripts/uitest.sh bench-step / bench-summarize / bench-compare`, [`benchmark-baselines.json`](benchmark-baselines.json) |
| **Perceptual review** | Does the audio sound right — naturalness, emotion match, pronunciation, pacing, artifacts? | ~30 s per WAV | [`gemini-voice-review.md`](gemini-voice-review.md), `scripts/uitest.sh gemini-review` |

The layers complement each other:

- The **smoke** catches "engine wedged / dialog blocked / WAV missing / DB row missing" — failures that are obvious from `pass=false` in `result.json`.
- The **bench** catches "engine took 2× longer than baseline" or "peak RSS doubled" — failures the smoke happily reports as pass.
- The **perceptual review** catches "audio is technically correct but mispronounces 'Vocello'" or "voice description was 'angry' but the take sounds neutral" — failures the bench's RMS/peak gates can't see.

No single layer is sufficient; the bench's RMS/peak gates are deliberately wide (±15 % alongside informational depth metrics) because the underlying LM sampling has run-to-run variance that the gates must tolerate. The perceptual review is the gate against subjective-but-real regressions.

## Decision table — what to run when X changes

| What changed | Smoke | Bench | Perceptual |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Engine code (streaming, KV cache, decoder, vocoder, anything under `Sources/QwenVoice*` or `third_party_patches/mlx-audio-swift`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Audio-path code (`PCM16StreamLimiter`, `AudioPlayerViewModel`, `GenerationPersistence`, WAV writers) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (primary) |
| UI / view code (`Sources/Views/`, `Sources/iOS/`, coordinators, view models that don't touch audio) | ✅ | — | — |
| Prompt/tone configuration (`docs/qwen_tone.md`, voice-description handling) | — | — | ✅ |
| Generation pipeline plumbing (cancellation, gating, request ID) | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| Saved-voice fixture changes (re-bootstrap UITestRef) | clone smoke + bootstrap | — | optional |
| Bench-baseline-affecting change (deliberate perf work) | optional | ✅ + promote new baseline | ✅ to confirm no quality regression |
| Build/packaging change | — | — | — (build proof is separate, see [release-readiness.md](release-readiness.md)) |
| Documentation only | — | — | — |
| Cross-process IPC / XPC code (`Sources/QwenVoice{Native,EngineService,EngineSupport}`) | ✅ all three modes | ✅ one mode | — |

**"All three modes"** for smoke = run `smoke-custom-voice`, `smoke-voice-design`, `smoke-voice-cloning` back-to-back. **"One mode"** for bench = pick whichever mode is most directly exercised by the change.

## Recommended entry points

- **First-time agent in this repo?** Read [`ui-test-surface.md`](ui-test-surface.md) once for the AX-id vocabulary + standard smoke/bench skeletons + completion signals. Skim [`testing-cheatsheet.md`](testing-cheatsheet.md) for copy-pasteable commands. Then come back here for the decision table.
- **About to ship a perf-affecting change?** Run the full bench matrix for the affected mode, then promote the baseline if the numbers are intentional. See the per-mode `bench-*.md`.
- **About to ship an audio-path change?** Generate one sample in each mode, run `gemini-review` on each, compare against a recent baseline review under [`build/Debug/voice-reviews/`](../../build/Debug/voice-reviews/) (gitignored — keep mental notes of typical scores).
- **Triaging a bug report?** Run the matching smoke first to confirm reproduction. If the smoke passes but the user complains about quality, run `gemini-review` on the offending generation's WAV.

## What's not in this layer

- Build/compile proof — `./scripts/build_foundation_targets.sh macos|ios|all` (see [`backend-freeze-gate.md`](backend-freeze-gate.md)).
- Static project validation — `./scripts/check_project_inputs.sh`.
- Release-readiness gates — [`release-readiness.md`](release-readiness.md) for macOS DMG sign+notarize, iOS TestFlight, and the macOS-first release-track policy.
- No CI, no XCTest, no parallel Python benchmark harness — those surfaces were retired in May 2026 (see [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) "Testing policy — important").
