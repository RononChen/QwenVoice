# iOS Increased-Memory Entitlement — Enablement & Readiness Guide

This is the source of truth for enabling Apple's increased-memory entitlement on the iOS app and engine
extension, verifying it, and the (kept-for-fallback) justification text.

Status context: [`../../CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) § "Release & iPhone status".

> **TL;DR — there is most likely no "request to Apple" to make.** `com.apple.developer.kernel.increased-memory-limit`
> is a **self-serve Additional Capability** (Apple DTS confirms it follows the same flow as Multicast
> Networking): enable it on each App ID, regenerate the provisioning profiles, build. It is **not** a
> justification-reviewed approval queue. See "How you get it" below for the one definitive self-check and the
> fallback if your account happens to gate it behind Capability Requests.

> **Status — 2026-06-01:** Confirmed self-serve and **enabled** (the plain "Increased Memory Limit" checkbox in
> the App ID → Capabilities tab) on **both** App IDs — `com.patricedery.vocello` (app) and
> `com.patricedery.vocello.engine-extension` (engine extension); "Increased Debugging Memory Limit" left off on
> both (it's the dev-only variant). Setup verified against Apple's official docs (see "Verify" below).
> **Remaining:** regenerate the provisioning profiles for both App IDs — Xcode "Automatically manage signing"
> does this on the next build; no Apple approval involved.

> **Note (device tooling):** the on-device *evidence-capture* recipes that used the removed
> `ios_device.sh` / `ios_device_proof_matrix.sh` scripts are **not currently runnable** — they were removed in
> the testing-harness cleanup and a device deploy/proof path would need to be re-established. The
> enablement, the device-free verification (`codesign`/`security`/`verify_ios_release_archive.sh`), and the
> memory evidence you can already cite (streaming ~3 GB, see `benchmarks/OPTIMIZATION.md` §F.1) do **not**
> need that tooling.

- [Request access to managed capabilities](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/capabilities/capability-requests) — **only** if your account gates it behind Capability Requests (fallback)

## How you get it (self-serve)

All entitlements must be authorized by the **provisioning profile** — so you can't just type the key into an
`.entitlements` file and expect it to take effect; the App ID must carry the capability and the profile must
be regenerated. But enabling that capability is **self-serve**: Apple DTS (Quinn) confirmed the
increased-memory-limit entitlement uses the same flow as Multicast Networking ("I just tested that process
here in my office and it works a treat") — no form, no approval wait.

**The one definitive self-check** (only your account can answer it): open the App ID in
[Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list) and
look for "Increased Memory Limit":

- under the normal **Capabilities** tab → **self-serve**: toggle it on, regenerate profiles, done; or
- only under the **Capability Requests** tab → **request-gated**: submit the request (use the copy-ready
  justification below) and enable it after approval.

Apple describes the entitlement as a Boolean for apps whose core features may perform better with a higher
memory limit on **supported devices**, and requires apps to behave correctly if extra memory is unavailable.
Use `os_proc_available_memory()` as advisory process-headroom data — it reports the bytes the current process
may allocate before its current limit, **not** device-wide free RAM. The increase is best-effort and
device/OS-dependent (see Caveats).

## Identifiers to enable

Enable the capability for **both** identifiers — the extension is the process that actually hosts the MLX
runtime, so it (not just the app) needs the raised limit:

- iOS app: `com.patricedery.vocello`
- iOS engine extension: `com.patricedery.vocello.engine-extension`

Related identifier:

- App Group: `group.com.patricedery.vocello.shared`

## Enable it — portal + build steps

1. Sign in to [Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list).
2. Open `com.patricedery.vocello` → **Capabilities** → enable **Increased Memory Limit** → Save.
   - If it isn't under Capabilities but is under **Capability Requests**, request it first (fallback section
     below), then enable after approval.
3. Repeat for `com.patricedery.vocello.engine-extension`.
4. Regenerate the development **and** distribution provisioning profiles for both identifiers. With Xcode
   "automatically manage signing" this happens on the next build; with manual signing, recreate the profiles
   so each one carries the entitlement.
5. Build for a physical device / archive for distribution. The production entitlements files already declare
   the key (see Repo evidence map), so a correctly-signed build picks it up.
6. **Verify the signed binary** (next section) — do not assume; the most common failure is the entitlement
   missing from the *distribution* profile (see Caveats).

## Verify the signed entitlement (device-free)

These replace the removed `ios_device.sh verify-entitlements` helper and need only a built/exported app — no
device:

```sh
# App + extension entitlements as actually signed (expect increased-memory-limit = true):
codesign -d --entitlements :- /path/to/Vocello.app
codesign -d --entitlements :- /path/to/Vocello.app/Extensions/VocelloEngineExtension.appex

# Confirm the embedded provisioning profile authorizes it:
security cms -D -i /path/to/Vocello.app/embedded.mobileprovision | plutil -p - | grep -A1 increased-memory
```

For a full archive/export check, `scripts/verify_ios_release_archive.sh` validates both the app and the
extension entitlements against `config/apple-platform-capability-matrix.json` (which declares the expected
bundle IDs, App Group, and `increased-memory-limit = true` for both targets). Pass condition:

```text
app:       com.patricedery.vocello                    com.apple.developer.kernel.increased-memory-limit=true
extension: com.patricedery.vocello.engine-extension   com.apple.developer.kernel.increased-memory-limit=true
status:    entitlement-ready
```

**Confirmed against Apple's official documentation** ([entitlement reference](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.developer.kernel.increased-memory-limit), [Enable app capabilities](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/identifiers/enable-app-capabilities/), and DTS [thread 685084](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/685084)): the entitlement is self-serve and enabled **per App ID** (an app extension needs it on its **own** App ID — enabling it only on the containing app does not raise the extension's process limit); `increased-debugging-memory-limit` is the **dev-only** variant (correctly left off for distribution); changing a capability **invalidates provisioning profiles** (regenerate them); it's supported on **iOS/iPadOS** (no visionOS target here, so the documented visionOS ambiguity doesn't apply); and the raised limit is **best-effort** — the app must gate on `os_proc_available_memory()` and fall back safely (already implemented).

## If your account shows it only under Capability Requests (fallback justification)

Use this as the main justification in Apple's Capability Requests form (only needed if the self-check above
lands you in the request-gated case):

```text
Vocello is a private, on-device text-to-speech app for iPhone. Its core feature is local neural speech generation using Qwen3-TTS model packages with MLX on Apple Silicon. The app downloads user-selected model artifacts and performs speech generation locally; prompt text, reference audio, generated audio, and voice data are not uploaded to a server for generation.

We are requesting com.apple.developer.kernel.increased-memory-limit for both the containing iOS app (com.patricedery.vocello) and the engine ExtensionKit extension (com.patricedery.vocello.engine-extension). The engine extension is the process that hosts the MLX runtime and performs the app's core generation work.

Our current hardware diagnostics use os_proc_available_memory(), task_vm_info, and Metal allocation metrics for both the app and extension processes. Without the increased-memory entitlement, the engine extension reports critically low process headroom before model admission on supported iPhone hardware. The app correctly blocks model loading in this state rather than risking jetsam. This confirms that the blocker is the extension process memory limit, not lack of general device RAM.

Vocello already includes guardrails for responsible memory use: model admission checks, combined app-plus-extension diagnostics, streaming-first iOS generation, disabled inline PCM preview payloads by default, bounded extension event streams, explicit MLX/Qwen3 cache trimming, hard trim and full unload paths, active-generation cancellation under critical pressure, and fallback behavior when additional memory is unavailable.

The entitlement is needed so supported devices can run the app's core on-device speech generation feature reliably while preserving the privacy benefit of local inference. If additional memory is unavailable, Vocello still behaves safely: the app remains usable for UI, model downloads, diagnostics, and user data access, and generation is blocked with a user-visible memory error instead of forcing a risky allocation.
```

Short-form answers (if Apple's form asks focused questions):

App or feature requiring entitlement:

```text
Vocello's on-device neural text-to-speech generation. The MLX runtime runs in the engine ExtensionKit extension com.patricedery.vocello.engine-extension.
```

Why the entitlement is necessary:

```text
The iOS model packages include large local Qwen3-TTS and speech-tokenizer artifacts. Even before model admission, diagnostics show the engine extension can have critically low os_proc_available_memory() headroom under the default process limit. The app therefore blocks generation to avoid jetsam. The entitlement is required for supported devices to run the core local generation feature.
```

How the app behaves without additional memory:

```text
The app does not bypass memory admission. It keeps UI, model download, ExtensionKit transport, and diagnostics usable, but blocks generation when extension process headroom is critical. During active generation, critical pressure cancels generation through the existing cancellation path and requests a full unload.
```

How memory is measured:

```text
Vocello samples app and engine-extension memory with os_proc_available_memory(), task_vm_info physical footprint/resident/compressed metrics, and Metal allocation metrics. Diagnostics compute implied process limit as physical footprint plus os_proc_available_memory() headroom.
```

How system impact is limited:

```text
iOS generation is streaming-first; inline PCM preview payloads are skipped by default; extension events are bounded; model admission blocks critical pressure; Qwen3 tokenizer, speech-tokenizer, prefix, and decoder caches are explicitly cleared on iPhone hard-trim/full-unload paths; active generation is canceled under critical memory pressure.
```

## Repo evidence map

Current identity and entitlement source of truth:

- `config/apple-platform-capability-matrix.json` declares both iOS bundle IDs, App Group, and the required increased-memory entitlement.
- `project.yml` signs `VocelloiOS` as `com.patricedery.vocello` and `VocelloEngineExtension` as `com.patricedery.vocello.engine-extension`.
- `Sources/iOS/VocelloiOS.entitlements` and `Sources/iOSEngineExtension/VocelloEngineExtension.entitlements` include `com.apple.developer.kernel.increased-memory-limit` for approved-profile builds.
- `Sources/iOS/VocelloiOSLocalDevice.entitlements` and `Sources/iOSEngineExtension/VocelloEngineExtensionLocalDevice.entitlements` intentionally omit the entitlement for ordinary local Debug installs (before you've enabled the capability on the App ID).

Process measurement and guardrails:

- `Sources/QwenVoiceCore/IOSMemoryMetricsBridge.m` calls `os_proc_available_memory()` on physical iOS.
- `Sources/QwenVoiceCore/IOSMemorySnapshot.swift` stores app/extension headroom, physical footprint, resident size, compressed memory, Metal allocation, and implied process limit.
- `Sources/iOSEngineExtension/VocelloEngineExtensionHost.swift` handles `captureMemorySnapshot` inside the extension process.
- `Sources/iOS/TTSEngineStore.swift` combines app and extension snapshots, blocks model admission under per-process critical or aggregate critical pressure, records peak generation context, cancels active generation under critical pressure, and requests full unload.
- `Sources/iOSSupport/Services/IOSDeviceDiagnosticsRecorder.swift` persists memory-context JSONL with app/extension headroom, footprint, implied process limit, aggregate pressure band, and `likelyEntitlementBlocked`.

Memory-reduction behavior already implemented:

- `Sources/iOS/IOSGenerationModeViews.swift` builds Custom, Design, and Clone generation requests with `shouldStream: true`.
- `Sources/QwenVoiceCore/SemanticTypes.swift` skips inline streaming preview PCM by default on physical iOS.
- `Sources/QwenVoiceCore/NativeStreamingSynthesisSession.swift` emits `previewAudio: nil` when preview data is skipped.
- `Sources/QwenVoiceCore/NativeEngineRuntime.swift` clears Qwen3 caches on iPhone unload/hard-trim/full-unload paths.
- `third_party_patches/mlx-audio-swift/Sources/MLXAudioTTS/Models/Qwen3TTS/Qwen3TTS.swift` exposes `Qwen3TTSMemoryCaches.clearAll()`.

## Memory evidence

**Available today (device-free):** `benchmarks/OPTIMIZATION.md` §F.1 — the iOS **streaming** path peaks
**~3 GB flat** with length on iPhone 15 Pro for Custom/Design Speed (short 2901 MB · medium 2860 MB · long-76 s
2992 MB), at/under the default process limit. So the entitlement is **headroom / Clone-and-long insurance**,
not a hard blocker for Custom/Design. (The ~7–8 GB figures elsewhere are the *non-streaming* bench path that
iOS never uses.) This is the necessity/sufficiency evidence to cite.

**When on-device tooling is re-established** (deferred — `ios_device.sh` was removed), capture an unentitled
baseline showing safe blocking, then an entitled baseline showing raised headroom. The extension-process rows
to extract from the diagnostics JSONL:

```sh
jq -r '
  select(.engineExtensionImpliedProcessLimitBytes != null)
  | [ .recordedAt, .event, .reason,
      (.engineExtensionPhysFootprintMB | floor),
      (.engineExtensionAvailableHeadroomMB | floor),
      (.engineExtensionImpliedProcessLimitMB | floor),
      .pressureBand, .aggregatePressureBand,
      .likelyEntitlementBlocked, .entitlementBlockedReason ]
  | @tsv
' <pulled>/diagnostics/memory-contexts.jsonl
```

Look for: extension snapshot present, extension headroom critically low, implied extension limit low,
aggregate pressure *not* the root cause, `likelyEntitlementBlocked=true`, and `model_admission_blocked`
recorded instead of a crash — then the same rows showing headroom rising materially once entitled.

## Caveats / things not to claim

- **App-Store-distribution gotcha (verify the signed binary!).** Developers repeatedly report the raised
  limit *not taking effect* in App Store / TestFlight builds — app still crashes around the default ~6 GB —
  even though it worked in development. The cause is the entitlement missing from the **distribution**
  provisioning profile / signing entitlements. Fix: ensure the capability is present in **both** the App ID
  **and** the signing `entitlements.plist`, and confirm with `codesign -d --entitlements :-` on the actual
  signed/exported build before submitting.
- **Best-effort and device/OS-dependent.** The increase is only available on some device models, the exact
  ceiling is undocumented and varies with device state, and iOS 18+ added a system memory-compressor cap that
  can still terminate the app. Always gate on `os_proc_available_memory()` and keep the safe fallback.
- Do not claim the entitlement will be available on every iPhone or iPad model.
- Do not claim the app will use all available memory.
- Do not say generation will be attempted even under critical pressure.
- Do not enable it only for the containing app; the engine extension needs it too.
- If you do hit the request-gated case, frame the justification as enabling the core local generation feature
  on supported devices with safe fallback — not as a raw performance optimization.
