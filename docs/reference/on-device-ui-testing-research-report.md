## 1. Executive Summary

> **Historical premise (2026-06):** Written before the fake-backend / two-tier XCUITest overhaul.
> The "missing agent-driven UI layer" gap was **not** filled — Tier-A/B deterministic XCUITest
> + `FakeTTSEngine` replaced it. Recommendations below are evaluation notes, not current direction.
> See [`testing-runbook.md`](testing-runbook.md).

Vocello already has a solid, low-level on-device test foundation:

- A headless generation harness via `scripts/ios_device.sh` for real audio/RTF/memory proof.
- A thin XCUITest smoke suite (`Tests/VocelloiOSUITests`) that runs on-device.
- iPhone Mirroring for human visual review.

What is missing is a **natural-language, agent-driven UI layer** that can reliably tap, scroll, and assert on the physical iPhone without writing Swift for every new flow. This report compares the strongest candidates.

### Top-line verdict

| Tier | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| **Best immediate fit (native iOS, today)** | Keep investing in **XCUITest on-device** (`scripts/ios_device.sh ui-test`). It is already wired, requires no new infrastructure, and gives deterministic, fast feedback. |
| **Best cross-platform / AI-agent path** | **Appium + the official `appium/appium-mcp` server** is the most credible MCP-native route to real-device iOS. It exposes session management, gestures, screenshots, and (opt-in) vision-based element finding to an LLM, but it requires WebDriverAgent signing and a stable MCP session lifecycle. |
| **Best low-maintenance, no-code real-device coverage (if budget allows)** | **Drizz** — plain-English authoring, Vision AI execution, and self-healing on real iPhones. It is a paid SaaS, not an MCP, but it directly solves selector-maintenance pain. |
| **Avoid for local physical iOS** | **Maestro** (officially simulator-only on iOS) and **mirror-pixel automation** (iPhone Mirroring + cua-driver) are not reliable enough to drive local physical iOS UI tests. |

---

## 2. Current Project Baseline

From [`docs/reference/ios-device-testing.md`](ios-device-testing.md):

- **Device:** iPhone 17 Pro paired via `devicectl` (CoreDevice), Developer Mode ON.
- **Build/sign:** `scripts/ios_device.sh` using `QWENVOICE_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`.
- **Headless proof:** `bench` autorun launches the app with env specs and pulls telemetry.
- **UI smoke:** `VocelloiOSUITests` runs through `xcodebuild test` on the device, relying on stable `accessibilityIdentifier`s (`rootTab_*`, `generateSection_*`, `bottomSheet_close`, `voicePickerRow_*`, etc.).
  - `VocelloUITestApp.swift` is the shared warm-app coordinator that keeps one app session alive
    across smoke/sheet tests and resets to Studio between cases.
  - `VocelloiOSSmokeUITests` covers launch + 4-tab reachability.
  - `VocelloiOSSheetUITests` covers voice/language/delivery/brief sheet regressions.
  - `VocelloiOSColdGenerationUITests` is the cold-launch exception: it kills the warm session,
    launches a fresh app with the engine enabled, and asserts that a real on-device generation
    completes.
- **Visual review:** iPhone Mirroring is used for observation, but synthetic clicks through macOS accessibility on the mirrored window are **unreliable** — the mirrored content is not a normal AX tree, and focus races make scripted tapping brittle.

The next improvement should complement this baseline rather than replace it.

---

## 3. Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Why it matters for Vocello |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| **Real-device iOS support** | The project’s workflow is device-first; simulator-only tools are a non-starter for release confidence. |
| **MCP / agent integration** | The user explicitly asked for MCPs or plugins that let an AI assistant drive tests via UI. |
| **No/low code authoring** | Faster iteration for product/UI flows, but must still be deterministic enough for regression gating. |
| **Determinism & flakiness** | Audio generation is already variable; the UI layer must not add noise. |
| **Maintenance cost** | Stable accessibility identifiers already exist; a tool that ignores them and relies on pixels or AI must prove lower long-term cost. |
| **Security / privacy** | Signed apps, device UDIDs, and Apple Developer credentials stay on the Mac; cloud options upload binaries and screenshots. |
| **Cost & lock-in** | Open-source preferred where possible; SaaS acceptable for specific high-value coverage. |

## 4. Candidate Analysis

### 4.1 Apple XCUITest (existing native path)

**What it is:** Apple’s first-party UI testing framework, built into Xcode. Tests are Swift/Obj-C targets that run against the app via the XCTest runner.

**Real-device support:** First-class. `xcodebuild test -destination 'platform=iOS,id=<udid>'` works today in this repo.

**Pros:**

- Already implemented; no new dependencies.
- Fast and stable relative to wrapper frameworks.
- Direct access to device APIs, orientation, app lifecycle, and app extensions.
- Uses the project’s existing stable `accessibilityIdentifier`s.

**Cons:**

- Swift-only authoring; non-engineers cannot write tests.
- Cannot tap system dialogs reliably (`addUIInterruptionMonitor` is flaky).
- Simulator is faster, so teams often drift toward sim-only CI, reducing real-device confidence.
- No MCP or natural-language interface natively.

**Agent/MCP angle:** There is no official Apple MCP for XCUITest. The closest is the **`xcodebuildmcp` MCP** already referenced in `ios-device-testing.md`, but its tools (`build_run_sim`, `snapshot_ui`, `tap`) target the **simulator**, not the physical device.

**Verdict:** Keep as the deterministic regression backbone. Add targeted tests for the Confirm-button picker flow and any other high-risk sheet interactions.

---

### 4.2 Appium + XCUITest Driver + `appium-mcp`

**What it is:** Appium wraps Apple’s XCUITest via a WebDriverAgent (WDA) runner and exposes a WebDriver API. The official **`appium/appium-mcp`** MCP server turns that API into MCP tools that an LLM can call.

**Real-device support:** Fully supported, but WDA must be built, signed, and deployed to the device. The MCP server has a dedicated `appium_prepare_ios_real_device` tool that downloads a WDA release, packages it as an IPA, and resigns it with a chosen provisioning profile.

**Key MCP tools relevant to Vocello:**

| Tool | Use case |
|------|----------|
| `select_device` | Pick the connected iPhone |
| `appium_prepare_ios_real_device` | Sign & stage WDA |
| `appium_session_management` | Create/attach/delete an Appium session |
| `appium_app_lifecycle` | Install, launch, terminate Vocello by bundle ID |
| `appium_find_element` | Locate elements by accessibility id / iOS predicate / class chain |
| `appium_gesture` | Tap, scroll, swipe, long-press |
| `appium_screenshot` / `appium_screen_recording` | Visual evidence |
| `appium_ai` (opt-in) | Vision-based element finding from natural-language descriptions |
| `appium_set_value`, `appium_get_text` | Form input and assertions |

**Pros:**

- True cross-platform (reuse concepts if Vocello ever ships Android).
- MCP-native: an agent can discover devices, start sessions, take screenshots, and drive gestures.
- Can attach to a session on a remote/cloud Appium grid (BrowserStack, Sauce Labs, etc.).
- Optional AI vision (`appium_ai`) lets the agent fall back to visual cues when accessibility identifiers are insufficient.

**Cons / risks:**

- **Setup complexity:** WDA signing, provisioning profiles, and `devicectl`/Xcode 16+ interactions are non-trivial.
- **Stateful session fragility:** Recent Claude Code versions (≥ 2.1.107) were reported to kill and respawn `stdio` MCP servers between tool calls, causing Appium sessions to be lost and remote device-farm sessions to leak ([anthropics/claude-code#51507](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/51507)). This appears resolved or mitigated in later builds, but it is a critical integration risk.
- **Speed overhead:** Each gesture traverses HTTP → WDA → XCTest, making it slower than native XCUITest.
- **Reliance on accessibility tree:** Like XCUITest, Appium cannot see what XCTest cannot see.

**Cost:** Open-source (Apache 2.0). Only cost is engineering time and (optionally) cloud device minutes.

**Verdict:** **The strongest MCP-based option** if the team is willing to maintain a signed WDA and a persistent MCP/Appium server process. It gives an agent real-device control without replacing the existing XCUITest suite.

### 4.3 Other Appium MCP Servers

| Server | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `argneshu/appium-mcp-server` | Python-based; requires a running Appium server on `localhost:4723`. Less actively integrated than the official package. |
| `mcp-appium-visual` | Adds visual recovery and an interactive CLI. Runs Appium + MCP together; useful for debugging but adds another dependency layer. |
| `AlexGladkov/claude-in-mobile` | MCP for Android (ADB), **iOS Simulator** (`simctl`+WDA), desktop, and browser. Explicitly simulator-focused for iOS; not a real-device solution. |

The official `appium/appium-mcp` is preferable because it bundles drivers, supports embedded local sessions, and has explicit real-device preparation.

---

### 4.4 Maestro

**What it is:** YAML-based mobile UI automation with a reputation for readable flows and fast setup.

**Real-device iOS support:** **Officially not supported.** Maestro’s docs and multiple 2025–2026 roundups state iOS **simulator** only; real-device `.ipa`/AppStore builds are not supported.

**Workarounds:**

- **TestingBot Maestro Cloud** and **BrowserStack App Automate** now run Maestro flows on real iOS devices, but this is cloud-hosted, not local-device.
- **Community patches** (`devicelab-dev/maestro-ios-device`, `maestro-runner`) patch a local Maestro install with an XCTest bridge and port forwarding. These are unofficial and require specific Maestro 2.x versions.

**Pros:**

- Very readable YAML.
- No complex locators; operates via visual/accessibility layer.
- Great for Android real devices and iOS simulators.

**Cons:**

- Local physical iOS is a hack, not a productized path.
- Community patch maintenance is uncertain and version-locked.
- Adds JVM/Node tooling without solving the core Apple signing problem.

**Verdict:** **Not recommended for local on-device iOS** at this stage. Consider only if the project later wants cloud-based Maestro execution through BrowserStack/TestingBot.

---

### 4.5 Drizz (AI-native Vision platform)

**What it is:** A Vision AI mobile test automation platform. Tests are written in plain English; a VLM reads the screen and executes actions on real devices.

**Real-device support:** Yes — iOS and Android real devices, simulators, and emulators. Can integrate with BrowserStack/LambdaTest clouds.

**Pros:**

- No selectors, no accessibility IDs, no Xcode test targets.
- Self-healing when UI shifts.
- Non-engineers can author tests.
- Claims ~5% flakiness vs. 8–15% for locator-based frameworks.

**Cons:**

- **Paid SaaS** with per-run pricing; vendor lock-in.
- No open MCP exposing device control to a local agent (it is a closed platform with API/CI integrations, not an LLM tool-calling server).
- Vision-based execution can be slower and less deterministic than identifier-based XCUITest for simple, well-identified flows.
- Screenshots of the app UI leave the local environment.

**Verdict:** **Best fit if the goal is to reduce test-maintenance overhead and empower QA/Product to write real-device tests without code.** Keep it separate from the deterministic XCUITest smoke suite; use Drizz for broader journey coverage, not for the fast regression gate.

---

### 4.6 Device Clouds (BrowserStack, Sauce Labs, LambdaTest)

These are execution venues, not authoring tools:

| Cloud | Authoring frameworks | Real iOS devices | Notes |
|-------|----------------------|------------------|-------|
| BrowserStack App Automate | Appium, XCUITest, Maestro, Espresso | Yes | Largest fleet; good CI integrations. |
| Sauce Labs | Appium, XCUITest, Espresso, Robotium | Yes | Enterprise governance features. |
| LambdaTest | Appium, XCUITest, Selenium | Yes | Cost-competitive. |

**Relevance to Vocello:** Useful for scaling device/OS matrix coverage without maintaining a device lab, but they do not solve the “drive tests via an AI assistant” requirement on their own. They are best paired with Appium or XCUITest.

---

### 4.7 macOS iPhone Mirroring + Accessibility/Visual Clicking

**What it is:** The approach attempted recently — use `cua-driver` or AppleScript to click the iPhone Mirroring window from macOS.

**Why it failed:**

- The mirrored iPhone content does not expose a meaningful macOS accessibility tree.
- Synthetic clicks at screen coordinates do not reliably route into the iOS app.
- Focus races and disconnects make scripting fragile.

**Verdict:** Keep Mirroring for **human observation only**. Do not build an automation layer on top of it.

---

## 5. Recommended Architecture

> **Historical only — not implemented.** The project adopted **Tier-A/B XCUITest** with a fake backend instead of Layer 2 (Appium/agent MCP). See [`testing-runbook.md`](testing-runbook.md).


A layered strategy that preserves today’s reliable baseline while adding agent-driven capabilities:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Layer 3: Optional broader coverage (paid / cloud)          │
│  • Drizz plain-English journeys on real devices               │
│  • BrowserStack/Sauce Labs device-matrix runs                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 2: Agent-driven real-device exploration (MCP)        │
│  • appium/appium-mcp + Appium + XCUITest driver             │
│  • Drive the physical iPhone with natural-language prompts    │
│  • Use for exploratory checks, screenshots, ad-hoc flows      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 1: Deterministic regression backbone (existing)      │
│  • XCUITest smoke suite via scripts/ios_device.sh ui-test   │
│  • Stable accessibilityIdentifier-based assertions            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Immediate next steps (if approved)

> **Do not follow** — superseded by the Tier-A/B XCUITest + fake-backend implementation (2026-06).
> Retained as audit history.

1. ~~**Strengthen Layer 1:** Update `VocelloiOSSheetUITests` for the new Confirm-button behavior (tap Confirm, assert `selectedID` change, dismiss).~~ **Done** — Confirm buttons are unified across voice/delivery/language pickers and the voice-brief sheet, with matching assertions in `VocelloiOSSheetUITests`.
2. **Extend Layer 1:** Harden `VocelloiOSColdGenerationUITests` against launch-time flakiness and add coverage for Design/Clone mode cold generation if those modes become critical paths.
3. **Pilot Layer 2:** Install `appium/appium-mcp` in a disposable local test (not in this repo yet) and run a minimal real-device flow: select device → prepare WDA → launch Vocello → tap a known `accessibilityIdentifier` → screenshot → terminate. This validates WDA signing and MCP session stability with the current Claude Code version.
4. **Decide on Layer 3:** Evaluate Drizz only after Layer 2 proves the maintenance burden; use a free trial against a non-production build.

## 6. Decision Matrix

| Need | Recommended tool | Why |
|------|------------------|-----|
| Fast, deterministic regression on device | **XCUITest** | Already wired; lowest overhead. |
| MCP/agent-driven real-device UI control | **Appium + `appium-mcp`** | Only credible MCP-native path to physical iOS. |
| Plain-English test authoring, minimal maintenance | **Drizz** | Best UX, but paid and closed. |
| Cloud device matrix without owning hardware | **BrowserStack / Sauce Labs / LambdaTest** | Pair with Appium or XCUITest. |
| Quick YAML flows on iOS simulator | **Maestro** | Excellent, but not for local real device. |
| Clicking the iPhone Mirroring window from macOS | **None** | Unreliable; use only for observation. |
