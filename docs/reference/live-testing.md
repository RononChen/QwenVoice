# Live Testing

This document describes the rebuilt QA orchestrator for local and CI validation.

## Entrypoint

Use `scripts/qa.sh` as the portable orchestrator. Xcode remains the build and test authority; qa.sh supplies deterministic roots, fixture setup, locking, and `.xcresult` parsing for the wrapped `xcodebuild` invocations.

```sh
./scripts/qa.sh validate
./scripts/qa.sh test --layer contract
./scripts/qa.sh test --layer swift
./scripts/qa.sh test --layer native
./scripts/qa.sh test --layer ios
./scripts/qa.sh test --layer e2e
./scripts/qa.sh test --layer perf      # opt-in audio-QC; not part of --layer all
```

qa.sh output roots:

- `build/harness/derived-data/`
- `build/harness/results/`
- `build/harness/source-packages/`
- `build/harness/artifacts/`
- `build/harness/.lock`

## Layers

| Layer | Purpose | Backing tool |
|---|---|---|
| `validate` | static guards, project-input checks, contract sanity, stale-reference checks | shell + Python |
| `contract` | fast contract schema and metadata checks | Python |
| `swift` | macOS unit/integration foundation tests | `xcodebuild` + `QwenVoice Foundation` |
| `native` | macOS runtime/XPC/native compatibility subset | `xcodebuild` + `QwenVoiceRuntime` plan |
| `ios` | iPhone foundation tests when an iPhone simulator is available | `xcodebuild` + `VocelloiOS Foundation` |
| `e2e` | macOS XCUITest smoke over the stub engine/final-playback flow | `xcodebuild` + `Vocello UI` |

The iOS lane returns a structured skip when no iPhone simulator destination is installed. Generic iPhone compile proof is still maintained by `./scripts/build_foundation_targets.sh ios`.

## Strict E2E

Hosted macOS runners can fail first-time UI automation because Accessibility/TCC permission has not been granted or because the app window is not frontmost in the accessibility tree. By default, qa.sh demotes those two environment failures into clear skipped results.

Release signoff on a controlled machine must use strict mode:

```sh
QWENVOICE_E2E_STRICT=1 ./scripts/qa.sh test --layer e2e
```

In strict mode, TCC and window-registration failures fail the lane instead of being treated as skipped passes.

For agent-driven local UI checks, use the Computer Use plugin to operate the built app directly. The XCUITest `e2e` lane remains useful for CI and explicitly requested controlled-machine proof, but it is not the default agent-operated UI validation path. For timing measurements, pair Computer Use with `./scripts/bench_ui_generation.sh ... --external-trigger`, which prints `READY_FOR_TRIGGER` (on both stdout and stderr) and lets the agent drive the UI action while the script times the post-trigger pipeline. XcodeBuildMCP's UI tools (`screenshot`, `tap`, `type_text`, `snapshot_ui`) target iOS Simulator and do not apply to the macOS `Vocello.app` flows.

## Agent vs CI Test Paths

The two macOS UI-control surfaces in this repo are complementary, not interchangeable. Pick the one that matches what you are doing.

- **XCUITest (`--layer e2e`)** owns deterministic stub-backed flows for CI and controlled-machine signoff. It can inject `QWENVOICE_UI_TEST_*` launch env vars to swap in the stub backend, an isolated fixture root, and a fresh defaults suite, and it attaches the full accessibility hierarchy to the xcresult bundle on failure. It cannot reliably drive SwiftUI sheets (Voice Design description) or `NSOpenPanel` (Voice Cloning reference clip) on macOS 26, which is why those modes have screen-load smokes only.
- **Computer Use (`mcp__computer-use__*`)** owns sheet flows, file pickers, and real-app interactions against the shipped `Vocello.app`. It drives the host input subsystem directly, so the macOS 26 "Disabled hierarchy" regime that the XCUITest smoke skips around does not apply. Combine it with `bench_ui_generation.sh --external-trigger` for timing. The shared accessibility identifiers under `Sources/Views/` (e.g. `textInput_textEditor`, `sidebarPlayer_bar`) are usable from either path.
- **XcodeBuildMCP UI tools** target iOS Simulator. They are not applicable to the macOS `Vocello.app` flows and there is currently no iOS UI test target in this repo. They remain useful for iOS simulator build/run workflows.
- **AppleScript MCP (`mcp__applescript_execute__*`)** is allowlisted and can send `tell application` events or keystrokes when Computer Use is not a fit. The bench's default mode duplicates this via shell `osascript`, which is *not* allowlisted, so agents should prefer `--external-trigger` rather than running the bench's default trigger path.

## Test Support Code

`QW_TEST_SUPPORT` is defined only for Debug/test builds. It gates:

- stub engine selection
- UI launch arguments and isolated defaults/app-support fixtures
- fault injection
- test-only XPC invalidation hooks
- opt-in benchmark runners

Release builds must not rely on `QW_TEST_SUPPORT` behavior.

## Result Triage

Every Xcode-backed QA lane writes build and test result bundles under `build/harness/results/<lane>/`.

Useful commands:

```sh
xcrun xcresulttool get build-results --path build/harness/results/swift_source_tests/build.xcresult
xcrun xcresulttool get test-results summary --path build/harness/results/swift_source_tests/test.xcresult
```

Treat the `.xcresult` bundle as authoritative when stdout only reports a generic `** TEST BUILD FAILED **`.

## Performance Lane

Performance and audio-QC validation runs through the opt-in `perf` layer. It is not part of `--layer all` and requires installed models under `QWENVOICE_AUDIO_QC_MODELS_ROOT` (default `~/Library/Application Support/QwenVoice/models`).

```sh
./scripts/qa.sh test --layer perf
```

The lane drives `GenerationQualityAuditLiveTests`, which manages the cold/warm/exhaustive matrix internally and consumes these diagnostics-only controls:

- `QWENVOICE_QWEN3_GENERATION_SPEED_PROFILE` (`current` | `legacy123-memory` | `adaptive-failure-only` | `balanced-all-modes`)
- `QWENVOICE_QWEN3_MEMORY_CLEAR_CADENCE` (`0` disables per-step MLX cache clears)
- `QWENVOICE_QWEN3_POST_REQUEST_CACHE_POLICY` (`current` | `always` | `failure-only` | `never`)
- `QWENVOICE_AUDIO_QC_OUTPUT_DIR`, `QWENVOICE_AUDIO_QC_MODES`, `QWENVOICE_AUDIO_QC_BENCHMARK_PROFILE`, `QWENVOICE_AUDIO_QC_REPEAT_COUNT`, `QWENVOICE_AUDIO_QC_COLD_RUNS`, `QWENVOICE_AUDIO_QC_WARM_RUNS`
- `QWENVOICE_AUDIO_REVIEW_ENABLED=1` enables the autonomous local audio reviewer after generation.
- `QWENVOICE_AUDIO_REVIEW_MODELS_ROOT` points at the QA-only ASR/forced-aligner cache, defaulting to `~/Library/Application Support/QwenVoice/audio-review-models`.
- `QWENVOICE_AUDIO_REVIEW_STRICTNESS` accepts `advisory`, `balanced`, or `strict`; `balanced` fails technical defects and transcript-completeness regressions while keeping tone and pacing findings advisory.
- `QWENVOICE_AUDIO_REVIEW_MIN_AVAILABLE_GB` defaults to `4.0`. After generation finishes, the lane terminates the engine service, clears MLX cache, waits for memory to settle, then skips ASR/alignment review when available process headroom is below this guard.
- `QWENVOICE_AUDIO_REVIEW_MEMORY_SETTLE_SECONDS` defaults to `2.0` and controls the wait before the review memory guard is evaluated.

Bootstrap review models once before enabling audio review:

```sh
python3 -m pip install --user -r scripts/requirements-audio-review-bootstrap.txt
./scripts/bootstrap_audio_review_models.sh
QWENVOICE_AUDIO_REVIEW_ENABLED=1 ./scripts/qa.sh test --layer perf
```

When enabled, the lane writes `audio-review/audio-review-manifest.json`, per-clip `review.json`, `transcript.txt`, `alignment.json`, and a human-readable `audio-review/audio-review.md`. If the memory guard blocks model loading, it writes a skipped manifest with the measured headroom instead of loading the ASR and forced-aligner models. These artifacts are QA-only and are not product UI or release-bundle inputs.

The app launches as a headless `.accessory` host (`QWENVOICE_AUDIO_QC_HEADLESS_APP_HOST=1` is forced by the lane), keeping the embedded XPC service alive without rendering UI on screen. A `vm.swapusage` preflight refuses to start when swap-used ≥ `QWENVOICE_PERF_SWAP_HARD_STOP_MB` (default 8 GB) or swap-free ≤ `QWENVOICE_PERF_SWAP_MIN_FREE_MB` (default 512 MB).
