# Rescue plan — continuation guide

> **Read this first if you are picking up the rescue work.** It is written to be self-contained: current state, exact remaining steps with commands and expected outputs, and the guardrails that previous sessions learned the hard way. Follow it literally; when this doc disagrees with the code, the code wins. Delete this file when Phase 5 (release) ships.

>
> **HANDOFF (2026-07-03):** through `004800d` is committed and pushed on `main`.
> The working tree has **uncommitted** iOS Clone reference-recording work:

## 1. Current state (2026-07-03, `main` @ `004800d` + uncommitted clone fix)

### Session update (2026-07-03 afternoon)

| Step | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1–3 macOS J1 + iOS bench | **PASS** | Same artifacts as ~00:30 table below; `004800d` pushed |
| 4 design listening | **OWED (human)** | Maintainer listens to History design takes on phone |
| 5a gates + macOS review | **PASS** | `gate-mac-gate-20260702-163644`; `mac-review-20260702-164903` |
| 5b release train | **PENDING** | Version bump / tag / DMG — after Step 4 + clone fix committed |
| Clone reference recording | **IN FLIGHT (uncommitted)** | Voices tab record works; Studio Clone path did not. Root cause: `IOSRecordingOverlay.onDisappear` deleted temp WAV before import. Fix: hoist recorder to `IOSGenerateContainerView`, `didHandOffClip` guard, deferred presentation (~350 ms after bottom-sheet dismiss), shared `ReferenceClipRecordingStash`; iOS-only "Import from Files" removed from clone reference sheet |
| Clone fix verification | **PARTIAL** | `build_foundation_targets.sh ios` PASS; `ios_device.sh test` PASS once (`ios-test-20260703-005411`); maintainer still reported Clone record broken → second-pass fix applied; **not manually re-verified on physical phone**; one later test run hit device auth timeout (`com.apple.sharing.authentication error 12`) — environment, not compile |

### Session update (2026-07-03 ~00:30) — bench + gate closure

| Step | Status | Artifact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 macOS J1 verify | **PASS** | `build/macos/bench-ui-xpc-bench-20260702-155134/` → 29/29/29/29 |
| 2 iOS bench-ui shakeout | **PASS** | `build/ios/bench-ui-ios-bench-ui-20260703-000049/` (telemetry mirror fix) |
| 3 iOS full matrix | **PASS** | `build/ios/bench-ui-ios-bench-ui-20260703-001546/` → 29/29 engine gate; HISTORY rows appended |
| 4 design listening | **OWED (human)** | maintainer listens to History design takes on phone |
| 5 macOS gate+review | **PASS** | `gate-mac-gate-20260702-163644`; review `mac-review-20260702-164903` |
| 5 iOS gate | **PASS** | `gate-ios-gate-20260703-003025` |

**iOS bench fixes (`004800d`):** mirror App Group diagnostics into devicectl-pullable Caches after each generation; `ensure_mirror` auto-nudges Reprendre/Resume when mirroring paused; bench-ui unlock retry; warm-take inline player dismiss between takes; voice-brief starter path skips Confirm.

**J1 root cause (final):** warm flush timeout (12 s) << long-take generation time after player bar.
Fix: `VocelloMacBenchUITests.telemetryFlushTimeout` + hard XCTFail; inline `await` app JSONL when hooks on.

### Session update (2026-07-02 afternoon) — superseded

Phone was `unavailable` in devicectl (Steps 2–3 and iOS gate BLOCKED). Resolved when phone reconnected; see ~00:30 table above for PASS artifacts.

### Also done: AppModel migration Phases 3b/5/6 (landed in `0df766b` + `411ce84`)

All migration phase comments in `Sources/iOS/App/AppModel.swift` now read
"complete-as-designed" — that is the final architecture, not a TODO:

- **3b:** engine calls deliberately stay in the per-mode views (they need four
environment-owned stores that predate `AppModel`); shared cancel lives in
`IOSStudioGenerationActions`.
- **5:** no `presentedSheet` enum (surfaces have different payloads/hosting);
the real fix was pairing the delete-model sheet with the focus backdrop via
`AppModel.presentDeleteModelSheet/dismissDeleteModelSheet`. System modals
(fileImporter/alerts/dialogs) intentionally remain local `@State`.
- **6:** `HistoryScreen`/`SettingsScreen` own their bodies; `IOSLibraryViews.swift`
and `IOSSettingsContainerView` deleted (the Voices-library branch was dead code —
live Voices tab is `IOSVoicesView`). All protected identifiers survive verbatim
(`docs/reference/ui-test-surface.md` regenerated); the only removed ids were the
dead branch's `savedVoiceMenu_*`/`savedVoiceDeleteConfirm_*`, unreferenced by tests.

Compile-verified (`build_foundation_targets.sh ios` BUILD SUCCEEDED). On-device
coverage via `gate-ios-gate-20260703-003025` PASS (includes default UI tests).

### Current performance reference (like-for-like lanes — NEVER mix)

## 2. NEXT ACTIONS — do these IN ORDER (handout for the continuing model)

> Updated 2026-07-03. Steps 1–3 and 5a are **COMPLETE** — do not re-run unless
> regressing. Remaining: Step 4 (human), Step A (clone fix), Step 5b (release train).
> If a step fails twice the same way, STOP and report — do not improvise new tools.

### Step 1 — J1 verification (macOS) — COMPLETE

**Status: VERIFIED PASS (2026-07-02).** `expected=29 engine=29 service=29 app=29 merged=29` +
PASS (`build/macos/bench-ui-xpc-bench-20260702-155134/`).

Root cause was **not** row-loss from async writes alone — the bench driver's
`waitForTelemetryFlush` used a 12 s warm timeout while `tapGenerateAndWaitForPlayer`
returns at first-chunk (player bar). Warm **long** takes were still generating when the
soft-failed flush let relaunch/terminate kill the app before `recordCompleted`. Fix:
length-aware flush timeouts (60/120/300 s) + hard XCTFail on flush timeout; inline
`await` app JSONL write when UI-test hooks are on.

**If rerunning** and the gate fails, use this triage tree (historical — do not revert fixes):

The `j1-verify-round3` run FAILED EARLY (log: `/tmp/bench-ui-j5.log`, artifacts
`build/macos/bench-ui-xpc-bench-20260702-142137/`) with a composer flake signature
(`textInput_charCount` never appeared). Rerun once on an idle machine (`pgrep -x xcodebuild`).
If rows still missing after a normal run, filter JSONL by `recordedAt` and inspect
svc/app gaps (see §3b J1 notes).

### Step 2 — iOS bench-ui shakeout — COMPLETE

**Status: PASS (2026-07-03).** `build/ios/bench-ui-ios-bench-ui-20260703-000049/`.

### Step 3 — Full iOS UI-driven matrix — COMPLETE

**Status: PASS (2026-07-03).** `build/ios/bench-ui-ios-bench-ui-20260703-001546/` → 29/29
engine gate; HISTORY rows appended. Closed in `004800d`.

### Step 4 — Design-mode listening pass (HUMAN ears; cannot be automated) — OWED

Takes live in the app's History on the phone. Ask the user to listen to the design
takes for dropouts/clicks. If audible: file the defect with the chunkTimeline row
(v5 telemetry localizes the silence window) BEFORE touching engine code.

### Step A — Clone reference recording (before release) — IN FLIGHT

Uncommitted fix for Studio → Clone → Reference → Record (Voices tab record already works).
Verify on the **physical phone** — mic is unavailable through Mirroring.

```sh
./scripts/regenerate_project.sh
./scripts/build_foundation_targets.sh ios
# rebuild/install on phone, then manual: Studio → Clone → Reference → Record → Use this clip → Generate
scripts/ios_device.sh test    # retry if device auth flake (error 12)
# commit + push when green
```

### Step 5 — Release train (Phase 5)

#### 5a Pre-release gates — COMPLETE

| Lane | Status | Artifact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS gate | **PASS** | `gate-mac-gate-20260702-163644` |
| macOS review | **PASS** | `mac-review-20260702-164903` (8 PNG diffs — visual pass) |
| iOS gate | **PASS** | `gate-ios-gate-20260703-003025` |

Optional re-gate after Step A lands:

```sh
QWENVOICE_GATE_BENCH=1 scripts/macos_test.sh gate
scripts/ios_device.sh gate
scripts/macos_test.sh review && scripts/ios_device.sh review
```

#### 5b Release train — PENDING (after Step 4 + Step A)

Follow `docs/reference/macos-release-qa.md` (version bump in `project.yml` →
`regenerate_project.sh` → tag → GitHub release triggers the DMG workflow). iOS
TestFlight lane is optional (`archive-ios` manual dispatch).

## 3. Guardrails (learned the hard way — do not violate)

From the post-mortem (repo-fatal):

- **Never** build simulator/fake-engine test tiers for iOS. On-device only.
- **Never** rewrite agent guides per harness/model. AGENTS.md is the single guide.
- **Never** land multi-hundred-line features without `macos_test.sh gate` /
`ios_device.sh gate` first. Reverts = planning failure.
- **Never** float `mlx-swift`/`mlx-swift-lm` pins independently or without a
benchmark-gated throwaway branch.

From this rescue (operational traps that WILL bite again):

- **LaunchServices double-instance trap:** never `tell application "Vocello" to activate` / `open -na` while a measured debug session runs — it can spawn a second
instance WITHOUT debug mode whose takes land in the user's real library.
`uitest_measure.sh prep/activate/finish` handle this correctly (persisted DebugMode
flag + PID-based activation + single-instance guard).
- **logd flush lag:** `log show` exposes fresh os_signpost events minutes late. Wait
on the history.sqlite row (what `bench-wait` does), never poll `log show --last Nm`.
- `log show --start` **rejects fractional seconds** — trim to whole seconds.
- **xcodebuild env:** plain env vars do NOT reach the test runner; use the
`TEST_RUNNER_` prefix (review lanes do), and expect on-device runners to be unable
to write Mac paths (use the xcresult-attachment fallback).
- **Engine JSONL auto-prunes oldest-first** — never isolate a run's rows by line
count; filter by `recordedAt` (gate bench) or the run label.
- **bash 3.2 +** `set -u`**:** expanding an empty array errors; use
`${arr[@]+"${arr[@]}"}`.
- **New/deleted Swift files require** `./scripts/regenerate_project.sh` before the
Xcode build sees them.
- **French macOS localization:** the Mirroring process is "Recopie de l'iPhone" —
mirroir needs `~/.mirroir-mcp/settings.json` (done on this machine); the device-state
OCR keyword sets are fr+en (`scripts/lib/ios_device_state.sh`).
- **RTF = audioSeconds/wallSeconds — HIGHER is better.** A drop is the regression.
- **Benches need an idle machine** — a concurrent xcodebuild contaminated a full
matrix (design/long 0.57 vs 1.11 idle). Check `pgrep -x xcodebuild` first.
- **devicectl** `screenIsLocked` **does not exist** on Xcode 26.6/iOS 26.5 — the visual
device-state probe is the authoritative interference signal.
- **iOS model downloads are SERIAL (concurrent disabled — maintainer, 2026-07-02):**
tapping Install on a second model while one downloads queues it; it starts after the
first completes. Not a stuck download. The maintainer rates the iOS download process
"in poor shape" — treat download-UX polish as a backlog item; do not enable
concurrency as a quick fix.
- **Driving the mirrored phone from the Mac (attended installs):** peekaboo `see`
cannot map elements inside the Mirroring window (video stream, no AX tree). See via
`screencapture -x -o -l $(swift scripts/lib/mirror_state_ocr.swift window-id)`, then
peekaboo `click` with screen coords (window origin/size from peekaboo `see PID:<mirroring-pid>`; screenshot px = 2× window points). Focus the app first
(`app focus`); a paused mirror shows "Connexion en pause" — click Reprendre to resume.
- **The iPhone MICROPHONE is unavailable through iPhone Mirroring** ("Le micro de
l'iPhone n'est pas disponible à partir du Mac", verified 2026-07-02). Voice
recording/enrollment is NOT broken in the app — it works when operated directly on the
phone (maintainer-confirmed same day). Never triage recording as an app defect from a
mirror session, and never drive record/enroll flows via the mirror; that step is
attended, on the physical phone.
- **Reference clip handoff:** copy the recorded WAV to a stable temp path (`ReferenceClipRecordingStash`) **before** dismissing `IOSRecordingOverlay`. The overlay's `onDisappear` must not call `stopWithoutSaving` after a successful handoff — use `didHandOffClip` / `handOffClip(at:)`. Studio Clone hoists the recorder above the bottom sheet; defer fullScreenCover presentation (~350 ms) after bottom-panel dismiss to avoid presentation races.

## 3b. Active work (2026-07-03)

- **iOS UI-driven bench — CLOSED (`004800d`).** Full matrix 29/29 engine gate;
  pullable telemetry mirror into devicectl Caches; shakeout + baseline runs PASS.
  Parts: `VocelloiOSBenchUITests`, `IOSStudioBenchHooks`, `ios_device.sh bench-ui`,
  `scripts/check_ios_ui_bench.py`.
- **macOS XPC bench-ui J1 — CLOSED (2026-07-02).** `bench-ui-xpc-bench-20260702-155134`
  → 29/29/29/29 PASS. Length-aware flush timeout + inline app JSONL when hooks on.
- **iOS gate — PASS.** `gate-ios-gate-20260703-003025`. Design dropout did NOT
  reproduce in benches; perceptual listening pass still owed (Step 4).
- **Clone reference recording — IN FLIGHT (uncommitted).** Symptom: Voices tab
  record/save works; Studio Clone → Reference → Record did not apply the clip.
  Root cause: overlay deleted temp file on dismiss before import; nested recorder +
  simultaneous sheet/fullScreenCover presentation. Fix landed locally; awaiting
  on-phone verify + commit.
- **"Recording broken through mirror" — RESOLVED (not an app defect).** Mic unavailable
  via Mirroring; physical-phone operation confirmed separately.
