# Vocello (QVoiceiOS) — iPhone Mirroring agent map

On-device MLX text-to-speech. **English UI** on test device. Cold launch: **Studio → Custom Voice**.

Full owner tour: repo `docs/reference/ios-agent-ui-tour.md`.

## Structure

Four bottom tabs (always visible):

| Tab | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **Studio** | Compose + **Generate** (Custom / Design / Clone modes) |
| **Voices** | Saved references + built-in speakers |
| **History** | Generated takes log |
| **Settings** | Model downloads (one at a time), prefs |

**Studio only:** segmented control **Custom | Design | Clone** at top (~y 108 in mirror window).

## Studio — Custom Voice (default smoke)

- Script composer: placeholder *Type or paste your script.* — **150 char** limit.
- Chips: **AI** (voice), **NE** (delivery), **AU/EN/…** (language). Default Aiden + Neutral + Auto/EN.
- **Generate** full-width bar **below** chips — do not tap chip row when aiming for Generate.
- Readiness: non-empty script + Custom Voice model installed (**Install Custom Voice** if missing).

### Custom generate loop (agent)

1. `describe_screen` → confirm `Custom`, script area, **Generate** label with coords.
2. Tap composer → `type_text` script (≤150 chars) → **verify `N / 150` with N > 0** (B.8).
3. `tap` **Generate** coords from OCR (not NE chip).
4. Poll / `measure` until `"Just now • Custom"` + duration.
5. **DISMISS_POLL** — up to 3× `describe_screen` (2 s apart) for **X** → **Dismiss** → IDLE.
6. If no **X**: `scripts/ios_device.sh launch` (B.7 RESET) — **never** Custom segment or Design hop. (`reset_app` failed on owner device 2026-07-04.)
7. History tab verify once at session end.

## Multi-clip reset (B.7)

After each generate: dismiss poll → IDLE **or** RESET. Change voice/delivery via chips only.
Script on empty composer: type-only + verify. Replace: cmd+a → **delete** → type → verify.

## Studio — Voice Design

- First chip **`+`** = voice brief (500 chars). Starters fill + dismiss. **Generate** needs brief + script.
- Do not confuse brief **`+`** with Clone reference **`+`**.

## Studio — Voice Cloning

- Two chips: reference + language (no NE). Pick saved voice from Reference clip sheet.
- **Do not** drive **Record new clip** via mirror — mic unavailable from Mac. Use existing saved voice.

## Voices tab

| Tap target | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Row body (name area) | **Studio → Clone** with reference staged |
| **▶** play only | Full-screen preview player — stays on Voices |
| Built-in row body | **Studio → Custom** with speaker selected |
| **Save a new voice** | Record flow — avoid in agent smokes |

**Navigation shortcut:** From Voices, tap a **built-in speaker row** (e.g. Aiden) to reach Studio → Custom when bottom **Studio** tab taps are flaky.

## History tab

- Row body → full-screen player. **…** menu → Play / Save / Delete take.
- Deleting a take does **not** remove saved voice from Voices.

## Settings tab

- Install models **one at a time** — parallel downloads not supported on iOS.
- Trash on model row → delete weights confirmation.

## Obstacles (auto-dismiss when possible)

- **Delivery** sheet — Confirm with Neutral OK for smokes.
- **Voice** / **Language** pickers — Confirm after selection.
- Onboarding **Install your first voice** — Open Settings or install any model.
- Microphone / Speech permission prompts — only on record flows (avoid).

## Skip (never tap in exploration)

- Delete saved voices (no UI exists — append-only list)
- Record / Save a new voice (mirror cannot use iPhone mic from Mac)
- Delete model / Clear History / bulk trash unless test explicitly targets cleanup
- Quality → Speed fallback paths (not applicable on iOS product)

## OCR hints

`Generate`, `Custom`, `Design`, `Clone`, `Studio`, `Voices`, `History`, `Settings`, `Built-in voice`,
`0/150`, `Generating`, `Streaming preview`, `Just now`, `Install Custom Voice`, `Confirm`,
`Delivery`, `Voice brief`, `Reference clip`, `Search voices`, `Cloned reference`.

## Tips

- Tab **labels** (~y 619–690) more reliable than icons alone; **Voices** tab often flaky — use row shortcuts **only for tab recovery** (§Driving invariants).
- Coordinates are **window-relative points** from `describe_screen` — use mirroir **`tap`**, not Peekaboo, when permissions enabled.
- Fallback observation: `scripts/ios_device.sh shot` if `describe_screen` capture fails (TCC / Space / paused mirror).

## Driving invariants (mandatory)

Full table: repo `docs/reference/ios-agent-ui-tour.md` Appendix **B.5–B.8**.

1. **O-A-V:** `describe_screen` → one action → `describe_screen`. No back-to-back taps.
2. **OCR-only:** never tap from memory or prior-session coords.
3. **Stay on Studio** for Custom voice/delivery/script changes — **never Voices tab between generates**.
4. **Dismiss poll:** after generate, 3× describe for **X** → Dismiss; else **`ios_device.sh launch`** (B.7 RESET).
5. **Script verify:** `N / 150` with **N > 0** before **Generate**; empty composer = type-only.
6. **Poll, don't sleep:** 5–8 s intervals (cap 120 s).

### Illegal transitions

- `PLAYER_INLINE → Voices tab` or chip change before dismiss
- `PLAYER_INLINE → Generate` without dismiss / verify
- `type_text → Generate` without `N > 0`
- `command+a → type_text` without delete
- `Custom segment` / `Design hop` as reset
- `tap` without prior `describe_screen`
