## What Vocello does

- **Custom Voice:** choose one of nine built-in Qwen3 speakers, then set language and delivery.
- **Voice Design:** describe a voice in plain language and generate it from that brief.
- **Voice Cloning:** record or import a reference you have permission to use, optionally transcribe
  it locally, affirm consent, and save it to your voice library. A clip without a transcript uses
  the genuine audio-only x-vector conditioning path.
- **Private generation:** after model installation, scripts, reference clips, history, and generated audio stay in local app storage unless you export them.
- **Ten languages:** Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, German, French, Russian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Italian, with automatic detection or an explicit language choice.
- **Local history and playback:** replay, search, export, or delete past generations without an account or a per-line subscription meter.

## Voice workflows

| Voice Design | Voice Cloning |
| --- | --- |
| ![Vocello Voice Design screen](docs/screenshots/vocello-voice-design.png) | ![Vocello Voice Cloning screen](docs/screenshots/vocello-voice-cloning.png) |
| Describe character, age, accent, texture, and delivery. Save a successful design as a reusable voice reference. | Record in the app or import WAV, MP3, AIFF, M4A, FLAC, OGG, or WebM. A transcript improves conditioning but is optional. Generation requires the visible consent acknowledgment in Settings; only clone voices you own or are authorized to use. |

Custom Voice and Voice Design support ten delivery styles at subtle, normal, or strong intensity, plus a free-text delivery description. Voice Cloning follows the reference voice and does not expose delivery controls.

| Models | History |
| --- | --- |
| ![Vocello model download settings](docs/screenshots/vocello-model-downloads.png) | ![Vocello History screen](docs/screenshots/vocello-history.png) |
| Install and manage the available model package for each voice mode from Settings. | Generations remain local and can be replayed, searched, exported, or removed. |

## Install on Mac

1. Download [`Vocello-macos26.dmg`](https://github.com/PowerBeef/QwenVoice/releases/download/v2.1.0/Vocello-macos26.dmg).
2. Open the DMG and drag `Vocello.app` to `/Applications`.
3. Open Vocello, then install models from **Settings > Model downloads**.
4. Generate from Custom Voice, Voice Design, or Voice Cloning.

The current DMG is signed with an Apple Developer ID certificate, notarized, and stapled. No Python runtime or local server is required. The attached [`release-metadata.txt`](https://github.com/PowerBeef/QwenVoice/releases/download/v2.1.0/release-metadata.txt) records source and toolchain provenance.

Upgrading from Vocello 2.0 does not require reinstalling models. Application data remains under `~/Library/Application Support/QwenVoice/`.

## System requirements and model variants

| Platform | Support | Model variants | Public status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mac | macOS 26.0 or newer, Apple Silicon, 8 GB RAM minimum | Speed (4-bit) and Quality (8-bit) | Vocello 2.1.0 is available now |
| iPhone | iPhone 15 Pro or newer, iOS 26.0 or newer | Speed (4-bit) | App implemented; public distribution pending |

Speed is the recommended default and uses less memory. Quality is a Mac-only option for machines with more headroom. The three recommended Mac Speed packages total about 7 GB.

Support floors and benchmark machines are different facts. Canonical evidence is produced on a Mac mini M2 with 8 GB and an iPhone 17 Pro. In the current clean owned-core Mac record, every Custom and Design aggregate cell generated at or faster than playback; Clone medium and long were approximately realtime or faster, while Clone short remained below realtime. The record is `passedWithWarnings` because accepted memory soft trims and long-cell audio-QC warnings remain visible rather than being hidden. See the [tracked benchmark record](benchmarks/runs/ui-generation/macos-xcui-benchmark-20260716-181853-b4c2e299.json) for the exact matrix and conditions.

Macs on macOS 15 can use the legacy [QwenVoice 1.2.3 release](https://github.com/PowerBeef/QwenVoice/releases/tag/v1.2.3). No Vocello 2.x backport is planned.

## Variation and reproducibility

The Expressive, Balanced, and Consistent variation settings trade take-to-take variety against stability. Multi-line batches share one seed so their lines form a consistent performance. CLI and benchmark callers can provide an explicit seed for reproducible evidence. Ordinary interactive generations are not presented as seed-replayable takes.

## Local-first privacy

- Speech generation runs locally after models are installed.
- Generated audio, recorded references, transcripts, saved voices, and history remain in local app storage unless you export them.
- Model installation downloads pinned model artifacts from Hugging Face.
- Reference recording requests microphone access. Transcript auto-fill requests Speech Recognition access and uses on-device recognition with the required system language assets.
- Voice cloning should only be used with voices you own or have permission to use.
- Clone generation remains disabled until its visible consent acknowledgment is enabled in
  Settings; the choice is stored locally and can be changed there.

Storage locations and deletion behavior are documented in [`docs/reference/privacy-storage.md`](docs/reference/privacy-storage.md).

## Vocello for iPhone

| | |
| --- | --- |
| ![Vocello Studio running on iPhone](docs/screenshots/vocello-ios-studio.png) | The iPhone app uses the same local Qwen3-TTS and MLX foundation with an iPhone-specific in-process runtime. It provides Custom Voice, Voice Design, Voice Cloning, recording and Files import, local history, and the memory-conscious Speed models. On-device generation, physical-iPhone XCUITest, and an optional signed archive/TestFlight lane are implemented. A fresh full multilingual physical-iPhone run passed all 19 hint/QC and 18 output gates with policy-accepted warnings; its exploratory record is excluded from clean performance trends. Public distribution still requires the maintainer-owned App Store Connect release process. |

Current implementation and acceptance status: [`docs/development-progress.md`](docs/development-progress.md).

## Build from source

Building requires Xcode 26 on an Apple Silicon Mac running macOS 26 or newer.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PowerBeef/QwenVoice.git
cd QwenVoice
./scripts/regenerate_project.sh
./scripts/build.sh build
```

Repository scripts are the authoritative build and test interface. `project.yml` generates the Xcode project, so edit it instead of the generated project file. To work in Xcode after generation, open `QwenVoice.xcodeproj`.

Generated native output is governed by [`config/build-output-policy.json`](config/build-output-policy.json): persistent platform caches live under `build/cache/`, temporary builds under `build/scratch/`, evidence and current symbols under `build/artifacts/`, and distribution products under `build/dist/`. Do not introduce another DerivedData root or a source-local `.build` directory.

The ordinary deterministic checks are:

```sh
./scripts/check_project_inputs.sh
scripts/macos_test.sh test
./scripts/build.sh build
./scripts/build_foundation_targets.sh ios
```

The iOS command compiles both the app and its standalone, app-host-free platform-policy XCTest
bundle for the physical-device SDK. It does not execute tests or require a connected phone. Xcode
26 does not support executing a tool-hosted, app-host-free XCTest bundle on a physical-device
destination, so this bundle is compile-only; physical runtime and UI acceptance use the explicit
device diagnostics and XCUITest lanes.

These checks are sufficient for normal commits, pull requests, and merges. XCUITest is explicit frontend acceptance: native macOS or a paired physical iPhone, never Simulator. Models, a phone, and UI evidence are not prerequisites for sharing development work.

Start with [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the human contribution flow. Maintainers and Codex tasks should also read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). Deeper references:

- [`docs/reference/benchmarking-procedure.md`](docs/reference/benchmarking-procedure.md): benchmark protocol and PASS-only publication

## Command-line tool

The source tree also builds `vocello`, a headless interface to the same local Swift and MLX engine. It is not included in the app download.

```sh
./scripts/build.sh cli
build/vocello modes
build/vocello speakers list
build/vocello models list
build/vocello custom --variant speed --text "The train left at dawn."
echo "Hello there." | build/vocello generate --variant speed --stream --json
```

The CLI supports single generation, mode shortcuts, batches, saved voices, speaker and model discovery, model installation, and benchmark matrices. Standard output is machine-readable; progress is written to standard error. See [`docs/reference/cli.md`](docs/reference/cli.md).
