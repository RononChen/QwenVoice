## Why Vocello

- **Private by default.** After models are installed, generation runs locally and your scripts, history, and generated audio stay in local app storage unless you export them.
- **No subscription meter.** Download the models you want, then generate on your Mac without paying per line or waiting on a cloud queue.
- **Three voice workflows.** Use a built-in speaker, describe a new voice, or clone from a reference clip you own or have permission to use.
- **Built for Apple Silicon.** Vocello 2.0 uses a native Swift + MLX backend instead of the older bundled Python runtime, keeping generation local, private, and Mac-like.

## Three voice workflows

      <strong>Custom Voice</strong><br>
      Pick one of nine built-in Qwen3 speaker presets, set delivery, and generate a clean spoken line. The fastest path when you want a consistent voice right away.

## Install

1. Download [`Vocello-macos26.dmg`](https://github.com/PowerBeef/QwenVoice/releases/tag/v2.0.0).
2. Open the DMG and drag `Vocello.app` to `/Applications`.
3. Open Vocello.
4. Go to **Settings → Model downloads** and install the voice models you want.
5. Generate from Custom Voice, Voice Design, or Voice Cloning.

No Python setup or local server is required. Install the app, download models from Settings, and generate locally.

The DMG is signed with an Apple Developer ID certificate and notarized with a stapled ticket, so the first launch opens with a double-click (no right-click bypass). To verify the signature:

```sh
xcrun stapler validate Vocello-macos26.dmg     # "The validate action worked!"
spctl --assess --type install -vv Vocello-macos26.dmg   # accepted, source=Notarized Developer ID
```

A `release-metadata.txt` (commit SHA, Xcode version, SDK, marketing version, build number) is attached to the same release for build provenance.

## Requirements

- macOS 26.0+
- Apple Silicon Mac
- Voice models installed from **Settings → Model downloads**

**Speed** models are smaller 4-bit packages for faster startup and lower memory use. **Quality** models are larger 8-bit packages for Macs with more headroom.

Vocello 2.0.0 is the first stable release of the macOS 26 line. For macOS 15, use [QwenVoice v1.2.3](https://github.com/PowerBeef/QwenVoice/releases/tag/v1.2.3). No 2.x backport to macOS 15 is planned.

Every GitHub Release from here on ships a notarized, stapled DMG signed with a Developer ID certificate. Installing it is a normal double-click flow with no Gatekeeper workarounds.

The iPhone app is maintained in this repository but is not a public download yet. When ready, it will ship through the App Store or TestFlight, not GitHub Releases.

## Local-first privacy

- Speech generation runs locally after models are installed.
- Generated audio and history stay in local app storage unless you export them.
- Model downloads come from Hugging Face when you install a voice model.
- Voice cloning should only be used with voices you own or have permission to use.

## Build from source

The `main` branch contains the current Vocello codebase. The stable release is tagged [`v2.0.0`](https://github.com/PowerBeef/QwenVoice/releases/tag/v2.0.0).

Vocello 2.0's native Swift + MLX engine runs outside the UI process and replaces the legacy Python-backed runtime.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PowerBeef/QwenVoice.git
cd QwenVoice
./scripts/regenerate_project.sh
open QwenVoice.xcodeproj
```

Useful checks:

```sh
./scripts/check_project_inputs.sh
./scripts/build_foundation_targets.sh macos
./scripts/build_foundation_targets.sh ios
```

## Command-line tool (`vocello`)

Vocello ships a headless command-line tool, `vocello`, built from source alongside the app (it is not
part of the app download). It drives the same local Swift + MLX engine in-process — no Python, no
bundled weights, models download from Hugging Face like the app — and serves two roles: scriptable
local generation from the terminal, and the deterministic driver for the perf/quality benchmarks.

```sh
./scripts/build.sh cli                 # build build/vocello
build/vocello <command> [options]      # run it (runs in place)
```

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `generate` | Synthesize one clip (Custom Voice / Voice Design / Voice Cloning); supports `--stream`, `--json`, and piped stdin. |
| `custom` / `design` / `clone` | Shortcuts for `generate --mode …` (also pick the mode interactively, or list them with `modes`). |
| `batch` | Synthesize many clips from a file with a single model load. |
| `voices` | List, enroll, or delete saved clone voices. |
| `speakers` | List the built-in Custom Voice speakers. |
| `models` | Inventory installed/available models (state, size). |
| `bench` | Drive the perf/quality matrix and aggregate the results. |

```sh
# Generate a clip (mode shortcut), or pipe a script in
build/vocello custom --variant speed --text "The train left at dawn."
echo "Hello there." | build/vocello generate --variant speed --stream --json

# Discover modes/speakers/models, then bulk synth (one model load)
build/vocello modes
build/vocello speakers list
build/vocello batch --file lines.txt --mode custom --variant speed --out-dir /tmp/batch
```

stdout is machine-readable (an output path, or JSON with `--json`); progress notes go to stderr. Full
